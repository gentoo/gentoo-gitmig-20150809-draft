  <longdescription>
    Interactive geometry program for exploring Euclidean geometry. You can
	create a construction, such as a triangle with a circumcenter, and then, as
	you drag the vertices of the triangle you can see the circumcenter moving in
	real time. Can be used to make high quality figures in LaTeX and is built
	using Qt.
