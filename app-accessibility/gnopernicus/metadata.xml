    Gnopernicus provides Assistive Technologies (AT) for blind and
    visually impaired person. It enables users with limited vision, or
    no vision, to use the Gnome 2 desktop and Gnome/GTK+-2
    applications effectively. By providing automated focus tracking
    and fullscreen magnification, Gnopernicus will aid low-vision
    Gnome users, and its screen reader features will allow low-vision
    and blind users access to standard GTK+2 and Java-based GUI
    applications via speech and Braille output.
