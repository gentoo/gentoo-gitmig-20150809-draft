  +nwn-cep-1.52-r1.ebuild:
  Added new 1.52 versions and closing bug #81248 and bug #129900. There are
  two ebuilds here, 1.52 and 1.52-r1, which are different. The 1.52-r1 ebuild
  goes with the split nwn/nwn-data ebuilds and is now masked along with them.
  The 1.52 ebuild should work with the current stable 1.66 nwn ebuild.
