  Reintroduce hal USE-flag by request of Ryan Tandy <tarpman@gmail.com>.

  #253872.

  04 Jan 2009; <chainsaw@gentoo.org> xf86-input-synaptics-0.99.3.ebuild:

  Version bump, adds support for input ABI 0 (older X servers), which users
  apparently expect. Closes bug #250112 filed by Chris Slycord

  +xf86-input-synaptics-0.99.2-r1.ebuild:
  More helpful FDI file comments by Bernard Cafarelli <voyageur@gentoo.org>
  so users can modify the FDI file easier. Removed the HAL USE-flag,
  upstream behaviour changes mean you need it now. Added messages to that
  effect. Revision bumped.

*xf86-input-synaptics-0.99.2 (04 Dec 2008)

  04 Dec 2008; <chainsaw@gentoo.org> +xf86-input-synaptics-0.99.2.ebuild:
  Release candidate 2 for the 1.0 release. Improved tap processing, ignores
  moves reported without a finger down. Simplified FDI matches on
  input.touchpad instead of on specific product names. With thanks to Donnie
  Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org> for forwarding the announcement.

*xf86-input-synaptics-0.99.1 (15 Nov 2008)

  -xf86-input-synaptics-0.15.2-r1.ebuild,
  +xf86-input-synaptics-0.15.2-r2.ebuild:
  Apparently using autotools correctly is hard. Reinstate the previous
  install hack as regenerating the configure script would take longer than
  the compile itself. Closes bug #237620 by Alexey Charkov
  <alchark@gmail.com>.

  Install upstream FDI file instead of trying to overwrite it with our own.
  Upstream has added more data to the file then our copy ever had. Delete
  older ebuilds.

  +xf86-input-synaptics-0.15.0-r1.ebuild:
  Patch out a reference to XF86_CURRENT_VERSION which recently disappeared
  in upstream X.Org git and block against the older synaptics ebuild. Both
