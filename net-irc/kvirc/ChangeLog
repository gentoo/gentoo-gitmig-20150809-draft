  30 Apr 2003; Caleb Tennis <caleb@gentoo.org> kvirc-3.0.0_beta2.ebuild :
  
  Minor change to ivp6 config in ebuild to allow it to work properly for
  users wanting ipv6 - by Simon Koch (skock@palisadescomputing.net).
  Fixes bug #15954.

*kvirc-3.0.0_beta2 (10 Jan 2003)

  10 Jan 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  A new version. KDE support and ssl support now work properly. This should
  be a lot better than beta1, and more stable than the cvs snapshot.

  26 Dec 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> kvirc-3.0.0_pre20021217.ebuild  :

  Some fixes.

*kvirc-3.0.0_pre20021217 (19 Dec 2002)

  26 Jan 2003; Jon Nall <nall@gentoo.org> kvirc-3.0.0_pre20021217.ebuild :
  added ~ppc

  19 Dec 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  A cvs snapshot, maksed for now. I hope it will fix bug #7131.

  28 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Use correct slots.

*kvirc-3.0.0_beta1 (01 Jul 2002)

  01 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  This is the 3.0.0 beta1 release. It compiles under gcc 3.x (fix bug #4127),
  adds working kde support which can be turned on and off, antialiasing and
  many other goodies.
  
  Note: the ebuild with version number 3.0.0 which existed for a long time
  was actually the 'xmas' release, a prerelease of 3.0.0 which should have
  been marked e.g. 3.0.0_alpha1. As it is, portage will not automatically
  update an already-installed 'xmas' kvirc to beta1, but you are encouraged
  to do so.

*kvirc-3.0.0 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
