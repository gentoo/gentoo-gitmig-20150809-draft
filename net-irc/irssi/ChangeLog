*irssi-0.8.5-r2 (12 Sep 2002)

  12 Sep 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: new rev bump with
  configuration flag fixes: several use/configure combos were toggled, the
  ebuild had "--enable-perl" instead of "--with-perl", etc. Lamer's socks
  stuff has been commented out for the time being so that I can unmask
  this now (but is being kept so that it can be uncommented later.)

*irssi-0.8.5-r1 (15 Jul 2002)

  24 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>: Added ppc to keywords

  15 Jul 2002; Ben Lutgens <lamer@gentoo.org> ChangeLog: Incremented the
  version number. Anyone with socks in use gets an additional depend on
  net-misc/dante-1.1.13. It's needed for libsocks.so and socks.h (otherwise
  toggling the option --with-socks does no good) needs more socks testing
  however so it's getting masked)

*irssi-0.8.5 (23 Jun 2002)

  23 Jun 2002; lamer <lamer@gentoo.org>: Updated to latest version from
  upstream. Fixes a topic string overflow DoS attack. Upgrade now.

  11 Apr 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org>: Update all glib dependencies to use
  glib-1.2*  in preparation of unmasking the glib-2.0.1 packages
