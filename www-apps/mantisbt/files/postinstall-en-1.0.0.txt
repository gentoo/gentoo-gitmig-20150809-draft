If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you can use the upgrade scripts
at admin/ to execute the pending database updates.

To install, visit: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/install.php
Then log in: administrator/root.
You can load up admin/check.php to see if everything is working correctly.

Then edit ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config_inc.php as necessary.

After you've finished these steps, please delete the admin/ directory.

Don't forget to read the online manual!!!
