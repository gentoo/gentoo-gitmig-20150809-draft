Completing setup:

To complete installation cd into the MediaWiki install location, but
make sure to start mysql first with:

$ /etc/init.d/mysql start

$ cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mediawiki/

The host directory, localhost, may change depending on your installation.

Then temporarily make the MediaWiki /config directory writable
to the  user the web server is running as. The quickest way is 
to make  the directory world writable.  For example:

$ chmod a+w config
 
Then access it, for example:

lynx http://localhost/mediawiki/config/
 
After setup move the newly created LocalSettings.php from the config/
directory to the main mediawiki directory, for example:
  
$ mv config/LocalSettings.php .

    Remember to restore safe permissions to the MediaWiki config/ and
    LocalSettings.php (which contains clear-text passwords).
    chmod a-w config
    chmod ug=r,o=  LocalSettings.php
    chown root:apache LocalSettings.php

After these steps MediaWiki should be accesable at
http://localhost/mediawiki/
 
Enabling Optional Features:

If you wish to enable image uploads then you must manually edit the
LocalSettings.php file to uncomment the \$wgEnableUploads line.  
If MediaWiki was built with the imagemagick USE-flag the directory
permissions are correct, otherwise you must install ImageMagick and
also adjust permissions on the images directory to allow the server
to write.  For example:
 
$ chown apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/mediawiki/images

Math Support:

If you wish to enable the math support then you must manually edit" 
the LocalSettings.php file to uncomment the \$wgUseTeX line.
MediaWiki must have been built with the math USE-flag enabled or the
necessary support executable will not be present.
You may also have to execute

$ texconfig dvips printcmd -

if you have not configured tetex before.


Things you need to have on the server:
- SQL database of your choice.
- dev-php/PEAR-Mail for external smtp server.

These are not installed as dependencies since it is possible to run the database
and other services on other machines.

It is very important that you follow all the major versions upgrade
instructions from the mediawiki.org web page,
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading 
Do not, I repeat, do not assume that we can upgrade from version to version just like this. Make backups before upgrading.
