You are almost done!

0. You will need to manually adjust permissions for the installation script to
   run:

   $ chown -R apache:apache ${MY_INSTALLDIR}

   When you're done with the installation, don't forget to make sure that only
   the data/ and pub/ directories are writeable by the webserver!!!

1. Review ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/bin/LocalLib.cfg and make sure all paths are set correctly

2. Take a look at twiki_httpd_conf.txt and modify your Apache configs as
   needed. Make sure your webserver can execute ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/bin/configure
   Pay attention to the ExecCGI option (see https://bugs.gentoo.org/134132).

3. Visit http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/twiki/bin/configure
   Most values should have been automatically set for you.

4. Read the install guide
