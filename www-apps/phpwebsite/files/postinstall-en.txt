phpWebSite is installed.

You will need to create a database for phpWebSite
on your own before starting setup.

Then change permissions for set with this script:

cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/phpwebsite/setup
./secure_phpws.sh setup

Once you have a database ready proceed to
http://$HOSTNAME/phpwebsite to continue installation.

Once you are done with installation you need to run:

cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/phpwebsite/setup
./secure_phpws.sh run apache users
