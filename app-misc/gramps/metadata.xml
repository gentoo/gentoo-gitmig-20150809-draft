GRAMPS helps you track your family tree. It allows you to store, edit, and
research genealogical data. GRAMPS attempts to provide all of the common
capabilities of other genealogical programs, but, more importantly, to provide
an additional capability of integration not common to these programs. This is
the ability to input any bits and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS and
rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base (in any order
or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis and correlation with
the potential of filling relationship gaps.
