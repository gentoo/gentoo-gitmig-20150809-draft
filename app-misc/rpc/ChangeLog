  initial release (#13209)
  rpc is a fullscreen console-based RPN calculator that uses the curses library. 
  Its operation is similar to that of modern HP calculators, but data entry has been 
  optimized for efficiency on a PC keyboard. Its features include extensive scientific 
  calculator functionality, command completion, and a visible interactive stack.
  ebuild submitted by Bernardo S. A. Silva <bsaslinux@globo.com>
