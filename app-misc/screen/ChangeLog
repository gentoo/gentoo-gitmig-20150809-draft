27 Jul 2002; Michael M Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild

  Small typo fix.. /dev/ptys/* in ebuild instead of /dev/pty/*. Don't think
  needs revision bump.

 16 Jun 2002; Michael M Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r3.ebuild

  Added in sandbox_predict to help correct a sandbox violation trying to test
   /dev/pty/* , this should take care of the issue.

  7 Mar 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11-r2.ebuild

  Removed sandbox file (addwrite /dev/vc) since it is no longer necessary
  with portage-1.8.18

*screen-3.9.11 (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> screen-3.9.11.ebuild

  Version upgrade patch submitted by Matthew Kennedy -- this renders the texi
  patch from the older version unnecessary, and adds missing documentation
  items.

*screen-3.9.9 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
