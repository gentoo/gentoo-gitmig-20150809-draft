  23 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  is removed.  Thanks to: jherfurth@arafox.com (Julien Herfurth) in bug
  #6856.

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  Removed the ungif USE flag, and added nls and imlib and truetype USE dependent
  compilation.

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a.ebuild :

  Version upgrade -- copied the 1.07a ebuild over, and updated its syntax from
  try to die and the copyright info.  Thanks to Matthew Kennedy for the update
  info.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
