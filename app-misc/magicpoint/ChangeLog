*magicpoint-1.10a (06 Aug 2003)

  06 Aug 2003; Mamoru KOMACHI <usata@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.10a.ebuild,
  files/50mgp-mode-gentoo.el, files/magicpoint-1.10a-gentoo.diff:
  Version bump.  Added cjk and emacs USE flags.  Upstream now supports
  Xft2 rendering engine.  However, it is not enabled because there is
  some problem with Xft2.  Included default font configuration file. 
  Added support scripts and sample presentation files.

*magicpoint-1.09a-r1 (12 Apr 2002)

  15 Aug 2003; Mamoru KOMACHI <usata@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild:
  Disabled VFlib support because it fails to build if VFlib is installed
  and no --with-vfontcap specified

  16 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  Added charset16 support if both nls and truetype are in USE.  Closes bug
  #12801 by nakano@gentoo.org (Masatomo Nakano)

  23 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  For some silly upstream reason, --enable-freetype disables it.  So, this
  is removed.  Thanks to: jherfurth@arafox.com (Julien Herfurth) in bug
  #6856.

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a-r1.ebuild :

  Removed the ungif USE flag, and added nls and imlib and truetype USE dependent
  compilation.

*magicpoint-1.09a (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> magicpoint-1.09a.ebuild :

  Version upgrade -- copied the 1.07a ebuild over, and updated its syntax from
  try to die and the copyright info.  Thanks to Matthew Kennedy for the update
  info.

*magicpoint-1.07a (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
