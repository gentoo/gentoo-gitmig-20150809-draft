DEFAULT GENTOO INSTALLATION

The default Gentoo installation is designed to work and be as secure as
possible out-of-the box as long as you have USE="ssl pam -opera".


USE FLAGS

+ssl    forces anyterm to only run over secure (HTTPS) connections.
-ssl    disables secure connections, all data will pass over the network in
        plain text, including passwords!
+pam    enables PAM authentication, so anyone with an account on your computer
        can use anyterm without any further configuration.
-pam    means that you will have to configure your own authentication
        mechanism.
+opera  Enables a workaround for a bug in the Opera browser, but you will have
        to modify apache's logging behaviour to prevent snooping by local
        users.
-opera  Disables the Opera bug workaround.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add the following flags to APACHE2_OPTS in /etc/init.d/apache2:
    -D ANYTERM
    -D SSL -D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST  # if USE=ssl
    -D AUTH_PAM                  # if USE=pam

2. If you have USE=vhosts then you need to add the following directives to
   each virtual host's configuration file:
    <Directory "${MY_INSTALLDIR}">
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

3. If you have USE=opera then you should disable logging of some requests. In
   each apache configuration file add env=!DONTLOG to each CustomLog
   directive. For example:

   USE="ssl -vhosts": edit /etc/apache2/modules.d/41_mod_ssl.default-vhost.conf:

   CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \
       "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b" \
       env=!DONTLOG

   USE="-ssl -vhosts": edit /etc/apache2/modules.d/00_mod_log_config.conf:
       CustomLog logs/access_log common env=!DONTLOG

4. Restart apache2:
   /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

5. Browse to:
   https://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/${PN}.html  # if USE=ssl
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/${PN}.html   # if USE=-ssl
