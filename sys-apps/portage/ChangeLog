*portage-2.2_rc10 (26 Sep 2008)

  26 Sep 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc10.ebuild:
  2.2_rc10 bump. This includes support for EAPI 2 which is identical to
  EAPI 2_pre3. This also fixes bug #230975 (problem importing selinux
  module). Bug #210077 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.5.x.

*portage-2.2_rc9 (21 Sep 2008)

  21 Sep 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc9.ebuild:
  2.2_rc9 bump. This includes support for EAPI 2_pre3 which implements the
  current EAPI 2 draft. If the draft is approved then EAPI 2_pre3 can simply
  be renamed to EAPI 2 in a future release. This fixes bugs #172496 (exclude
  file compression), #177863 (SRC_URI arrows), #222091 ("Argument list too
  long" errors), and #238251 (einfo shows args on separate lines). Bug #210077
  tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.5.x.

  12 Aug 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc8.ebuild:
  2.2_rc8 bump. This fixes a regression in rc7 which results in a KeyError
  when ACCEPT_LICENSE is set (bug #234478). Bug #210077 tracks all bugs
  fixed since 2.1.5.x.

*portage-2.2_rc7 (10 Aug 2008)

  10 Aug 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc7.ebuild:
  2.2_rc7 bump. This fixes bugs #233735 (default phase functions),
  #234100 (update man page headers), and #234157 (remove BUILD_PREFIX
  from make.conf man page). This also fixes a known regression in blocker
  file collision handling which in some cases caused colliding files to be
  removed when they should have been kept. Bug #210077 tracks all bugs
  fixed since 2.1.5.x.

*portage-2.2_rc6 (01 Aug 2008)

  01 Aug 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc6.ebuild:
  2.2_rc6 bump. This fixes bugs #94133 (userfetch access check), #229033
  #233252 (repoman manifest commit optimization for svn), #233253 (unhandled

  30 Jul 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc5.ebuild:
  2.2_rc5 bump. This version adds support for EAPI="2_pre1" which has
  some changes in conditional USE dep syntax. The previous experimental
  EAPI="2_pre0" value is no longer supported. For more information about
  experimental EAPI features, refer to bug #233213 and also see the
  "Ebuild" chapter of the html documentation that is installed with
  portage when USE=doc is enabled.

*portage-2.2_rc4 (28 Jul 2008)

  28 Jul 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc4.ebuild:
  2.2_rc4 bump. This fixes bugs #206773 (ionice config via make.conf),
  #228085 (summarize elog file collision messages), #228117 (handle
  make.conf ending without newline), #232924 (list package sets when given
  an invalid set argument), #233077 (new QA check to verify that LDFLAGS is
  respected), and #233137 (AttributeError when unmerging a set). Bug #210077
  tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.5.x. This version adds support for a new
  EAPI="2_pre0" value that can be used in ebuilds when testing new features
  such as USE dependencies. This is an experimental EAPI that will not be
  supported after the final EAPI 2 is defined. For more information about
  experimental EAPI features, refer to the "Ebuild" chapter of the html
  documentation that is installed with portage when USE=doc is enabled.

  25 Jul 2008; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> portage-2.1.1-r2.ebuild:

  23 Jul 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc3.ebuild:
  2.2_rc3 bump. This fixes a regression in rc2 which caused --with-bdeps
  to default to 'n' instead of 'y' for --depclean and --prune actions.

*portage-2.2_rc2 (23 Jul 2008)

  23 Jul 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_rc2.ebuild:
  2.2_rc2 bump. This fixes bugs #12768 (--keep-going), #147516 (--jobs),
  #226307 (problem unmerging slots that don't belong to a package set),
  #228489 (restore repoman ci), #228595 (bogus repo_name warning),

  -portage-2.2_pre8.ebuild, +portage-2.2_rc1.ebuild:
  First release candidate of portage-2.2

*portage-2.1.5.6 (17 Jun 2008)

  17 Jun 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.6.ebuild:
  2.1.5.6 bump. This fixes bug #223417 (random KeyError during merge
  phase with <python-2.5). Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since
  2.1.4.x.

  16 Jun 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org>
  portage-2.1.5.5.ebuild, portage-2.2_pre7-r1.ebuild,
  portage-2.2_pre8.ebuild:
  Bug #223417 - Temporarily bump the python dep to >=python-2.5 for
  float mtime support. This dep can revert to python-2.4 when bug
  #223417 is fixed.

*portage-2.1.5.5 (12 Jun 2008)

  12 Jun 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.5.ebuild:
  2.1.5.5 bump. This release has support for package contents indexing,
  to optimize owner lookups for things like `portageq owners`. You may
  notice an abnormally large amount of disk activity when the package
  contents are indexed for the first time (triggered after a few merges
  or when a file collision occurs). There are two new repoman checks
  called 'inherit.autotools' and 'IUSE.undefined' (bug #224271). A
  KeyError triggered by ROOT definition in make.conf is fixed. Keyword
  mask warnings for installed package are suppressed in some more cases
  (bug #225767). Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.2_pre8 (10 Jun 2008)

  10 Jun 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_pre8.ebuild:
  Add another testrelease to fix bugs #223591 and #220671, and to sync
  features with 2.1

*portage-2.1.5.4 (05 Jun 2008)

  05 Jun 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.4.ebuild:
  2.1.5.4 bump. This fixes bug #224713 (unhandled TypeError exception
  when make.conf is missing). Mask warnings for installed packages (from
  bug #223447) should be less annoying now since they are triggered less
  frequently. A bash regular expression inside 'doman' is fixed for
  compatibility with FreeBSD (regression from 2.1.5.3). Bug #216231
  tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.2_pre7-r1 (02 Jun 2008)

  02 Jun 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> -portage-2.2_pre3.ebuild,
  -portage-2.2_pre5.ebuild, -portage-2.2_pre6.ebuild,
  -portage-2.2_pre7.ebuild, +portage-2.2_pre7-r1.ebuild:
  Fix several critical bugs in the NEEDED conversion code, requiring all
  NEEDED.ELF.2 files to be regenerated.

*portage-2.1.5.3 (01 Jun 2008)

  01 Jun 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.3.ebuild:
  2.1.5.3 bump. This fixes bugs #223417 (KeyError in merge phase),
  #223447 (depclean removes newly installed packages), and #223685
  (elog messages lost after build failure). Bug #216231 tracks all
  bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

  29 May 2008; Ali Polatel <hawking@gentoo.org> portage-2.2_pre3.ebuild,
  portage-2.2_pre5.ebuild, portage-2.2_pre6.ebuild, portage-2.2_pre7.ebuild:
  python_mod_{cleanup,optimize} are ROOT aware.

  23 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> portage-2.2_pre7.ebuild:
  Stop building and installing tbz2tool for Bug #220701.

*portage-2.2_pre7 (22 May 2008)

  22 May 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_pre7.ebuild:
  Adding new (last?) testrelease snapshot, removing bogus notifications
  about preserved libs.

*portage-2.1.5.2 (20 May 2008)

  20 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.2.ebuild:
  2.1.5.2 bump. This fixes a regression which prevented sys-apps/portage
  updates from being promoted to the front of the merge list. There are
  a few other small fixes, including bug #222623. Bug #216231 tracks all
  bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5 (14 May 2008)

  14 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5.ebuild:

  Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc10 (10 May 2008)

  10 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc10.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc10 bump. This fixes the KeyError reported in bug #221107,
  comment #4. Also, satisfied blockers are now shown in the merge list
  in any case when blocking packages will be temporarily installed
  simultaneously. For Bug #220701, the ebuild no longer installs tbz2tool.
  Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc9 (09 May 2008)

  09 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc9.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc9 bump. This fixes bugs #221053 (enable --skipfirst as a means
  to bypass digest failures), #221071 (merge list displayed twice), and
  #221107 (KeyError triggered by blockers). Bug #216231 tracks all bugs
  fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc8 (09 May 2008)

  09 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc8.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc8 bump. This includes support for having packages that block
  eachother temporarily installed at the same time, which requires
  special handling of file collisions. Also fixed are bugs #220341
  (unnecessary reinstall of multislot packages), #220689 (unnecessary
  downgrades), #220775 (dodoc calls vecho unsuccessfully), and #220987
  (UnboundLocalError during dep calculations for alternate ROOT).
  Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc7 (06 May 2008)

  06 May 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc7.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc7 bump. The most notable bug fixed in this release is #172812.
  Blockers are now resolved automatically in cases when it makes
  sense to uninstall a conflicting package. Automatically uninstalled
  packages are displayed in the merge list, marked "uninstall" and
  highlighted in red. Other bugs fixed in this release include #172812,
  #211833, #218854, #219286, #219294, #219369, #219837, #219918, #219957,
  and #220171. Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

  New testrelease including rewritten support for FEATURES=preserve-libs and
  several updates regarding package set handling

*portage-2.1.5_rc6 (21 Apr 2008)

  21 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc6.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc6 bump. The metadata-transfer feature is now disabled by default.
  This disables the "Updating Portage cache" routine that used to run at
  the tail end of each `emerge --sync` operation. If you use something like
  the sqlite module and want to keep all metadata in that format alone
  (useful for querying), enable FEATURES="metadata-transfer" in make.conf.
  Also fixed in this release are bugs #218439 (emerge --help formatting)
  and #218559 (sandbox violations in /var/cache/edb/dep by portage api
  consumers). Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc5 (19 Apr 2008)

  19 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc5.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc5 bump. This fixes bug #217905 (broken evaluation of conditionals
  in SRC_URI), bug #218202 (unwanted spinner output with --nodeps), and
  also fixes spurious permission adjustments from bug #162542. Bug #216231
  tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc4 (15 Apr 2008)

  15 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc4.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc4 bump. The dependency resolver now has a feedback mechanism that
  helps make atom selections more consistent with previous selections that
  have been added to the graph. This solves some common cases of bug #1343
  such as the issue with kaffe pulling in an unnecessary jdk slot in bug
  #163801. Also fixed is bug #217664. Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed
  since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc3 (12 Apr 2008)

  12 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc3.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc3 bump. Unlike earlier 2.1.5_rc releases, emerge is now fixed
  to automatically downgrade masked packages when appropriate (solves a
  side effect from the fix for bug #197810). Also fixed are bugs #162542,
  #197905, #215016, #217122, and #217444. Bug #216231 tracks all bugs
  fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.1.5_rc2 (05 Apr 2008)

  05 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc2.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc2 bump for bug #216328 (fix broken --newuse).

*portage-2.1.5_rc1 (04 Apr 2008)

  04 Apr 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.5_rc1.ebuild:
  2.1.5_rc1 release. In the event that a previously installed package has
  since been masked, emerge will no longer perform an automatic downgrade
  as part of a "world" update. You should either unmask such packages or
  else explicitly re-merge them in order to have them dowgraded to an
  unmasked version. Bug #216231 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.4.x.

*portage-2.2_pre5 (19 Mar 2008)

  19 Mar 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> -portage-2.2_pre4.ebuild,
  +portage-2.2_pre5.ebuild:

  09 Mar 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> +portage-2.2_pre4.ebuild:
  Another prerelease, most important changes are the removal of manifest1 support
  and a potential data corruption issue with elog messages (bug #212055). 
  Other minor fixes include bug #212152, bug #97776, bug #211949 and bug #212080.

*portage-2.2_pre3 (28 Feb 2008)

  28 Feb 2008; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org> -portage-2.2_pre2.ebuild,
  +portage-2.2_pre3.ebuild:
  Bump 2.2 test release to bring it back in line with 2.1 releases 
  regarding bugfixes/features. Change epydoc dependency to avoid
  a traceback during API doc generation with >=epydoc-3.

  12 Feb 2008; Zac Medico <zmedico@gentoo.org> +portage-2.1.4.4.ebuild:
  2.1.4.4 bump. This fixes bug #209768 (missing digest triggers emerge
  --search traceback). Bug #200044 tracks all bugs fixed since 2.1.3.x.
