Here's a list of stuff to add/fix in Portage 1.5:

Add a flag to force a merge even if RDEPEND settings aren't satisfied.

Update DEPEND and RDEPEND so that we can reference the USE setting, allowing us
to depend on a package with certain functionality enabled or disabled.

Update DEPEND and RDEPEND so that we can provide an alternative if
functionality isn't enabled, i.e.:

	foo? ( sys-apps/bar : sys-apps/meep )

For package installs, runtime dependencies should be calculated using the USE
setting contained in the .tbz2 metadata rather than the USE setting in
/etc/make.conf/defaults.

/fix in/fix indd MULTIPLE support.  Make Portage default to only allowing a
single version of a package installed at one time.  MULTIPLE will allow users
to override this behavior:

		MULTIPLE="major" or 1 means that foo/bar-1.0 and foo/bar-2.0 can be installed together
		MULTIPLE="minor" or 2 means that foo/bar-1.0, 2.0, and 2.1 can be installed together
		MULTIPLE=3,4,5,etc.
  		MULTIPLE=0 means no restrictions (even foo/bar-1.0 and foo/bar-1.0-r1 can be installed together)
		Also need to add a system-wide override option for this one.        

Add csh support to env-update
 
Upgrade fetch feature to eliminate partial download problem
  
Enhance /usr/sbin/ebuild so that it can recursively merge packages.  Base this
on the digraph code in /usr/sbin/pkgmerge
   
Add system profile support to the portage-maintain code
