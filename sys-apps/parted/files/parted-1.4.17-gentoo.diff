+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
+read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
+available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
+
+   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
+environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
+to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
+to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
+(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.

+Using `gettext' in new packages
+===============================
+
+   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
+internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
+package.  Of course the GNU General Public License applies to your
+sources from then on if you include `gettext' directly in your
+distribution but since you are writing free software anyway this is no
+restriction.
+
+   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
+to use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
+Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
+developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
+applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
+`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
+the translation teams.

+/* This file redirects the gettext functions (without prefix or suffix) to
+   those defined in the included GNU gettext library (with "__" suffix).
+   It is compiled into libintl when the included GNU gettext library is
+   configured --with-included-gettext.
+
+   This redirection works also in the case that the system C library or
+   the system libintl library contain gettext/textdomain/... functions.
+   If it didn't, we would need to add preprocessor level redirections to
+   libgnuintl.h of the following form:
+
+#    define gettext gettext__
+#    define dgettext dgettext__
+#    define dcgettext dcgettext__
+#    define ngettext ngettext__
+#    define dngettext dngettext__
+#    define dcngettext dcngettext__
+#    define textdomain textdomain__
+#    define bindtextdomain bindtextdomain__
+#    define bind_textdomain_codeset bind_textdomain_codeset__
+
+   How does this redirection work? There are two cases.
+   A. When libintl.a is linked into an executable, it works because
+      functions defined in the executable always override functions in
+      the shared libraries.
+   B. When libintl.so is used, it works because
+      1. those systems defining gettext/textdomain/... in the C library
+         (namely, Solaris 2.4 and newer, and GNU libc 2.0 and newer) are
+         ELF systems and define these symbols as weak, thus explicitly
+         letting other shared libraries override it.
+      2. those systems defining gettext/textdomain/... in a standalone
+         libintl.so library (namely, Solaris 2.3 and newer) have this
+         shared library in /usr/lib, and the linker will search /usr/lib
+         *after* the directory where the GNU gettext library is installed.
+
+   A third case, namely when libintl.a is linked into a shared library
+   whose name is not libintl.so, is not supported. In this case, on
+   Solaris, when -lintl precedes the linker option for the shared library
+   containing GNU gettext, the system's gettext would indeed override
+   the GNU gettext. Anyone doing this kind of stuff must be clever enough
+   to 1. compile libintl.a with -fPIC, 2. remove -lintl from his linker
+   command line.  */
