  21 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>:
  updated keywords (ppc)

  13 July 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.34-r8.ebuild

  Corrected an issue where we were attempting "sed"ing the Configure file from the wrong directory so it
  never happened. 
  Includes chadh's cardmgr with -f patch (this was included in -r7 but someone didn't edit the ChangeLog)
  Added the use of the wavelan USE var to disable the use of the Orinoco drivers if +wavelan is set.
  Corrected a problem where pkg_postinst() was called src_postinst() so our post install info was never
  being displayed 

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.35_beta2 (12 July 2002)

  12 July 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.35_beta2.ebuild
  
  Since .34 and lower have some very very annoying and dibilitating (sp) bugs in them I'm creating this..
  It carries over my fixes from .34-r6 still as they haven't been made upstream yet
  There is no beta1 ebuild, only beta2 as the file this ebuild uses is the 2nd beta file released

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.34 (12 July 2002)

  12 July 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.34-r6.ebuild

  It was also a bug on PCMCIA-CS's official site.
  Updated orinoco to 0.12b and corrected another ebuild typo.

  02 July 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.34-r2.ebuild

  Well, it appears that there is bug in cardmgr.  This is an attempted fix.

  01 July 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.34-r1.ebuild

  Updated orinoco drivers to version 0.12

  01 July 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.34.ebuild

  Added KEYWORDS.

  08 June 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>

  Added ppc fixes to this ebuild.  Left new orinoco driver section in (but commented as it is still testing)


*pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r4 (01 May 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r4.ebuild :

  01 May 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r4.ebuild files/digest-pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r4 :

  Added new version of the orinoco_cs driver. The SMC2632W card now works
  again.

  Cleaned up this horrid ChangeLog somewhat.

  Old revision kept, new revision masked, as the new orinoco driver 
  hasn't recived adequate testing.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r3,pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r7 (28 Mar 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r3.ebuild :

  removed X support, a much-requested change.  No rev bump.

  28 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> :

  changed doins to doexe for installing the network script executably

  28 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> :

  typo in the stop code.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r2, pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r6 (19 Mar 2002)

  19 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> :

  hacked up the /etc/pcmcia/network script that cardmgr uses to start network
  iterfaces to call Gentoo's network init scripts

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.33-r1 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> :

  newest version of pcmcia-cs

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r5 (14 Mar 2002)

  14 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org>: pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r5.ebuild :

  The test for the nocardbus USE flag was reversed. Fixed.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r4 (14 Mar 2002)

  14 Mar 2002; Chad Huneycutt <chadh@gentoo.org> : 

  many fixes:
  1. added USE variables for trusted apps, apm, cardbus, and pnp
  2. updated init script to die slightly more gracefully when cardmgr
     cannot start
  3. changed configuration settings for init script (previously
     /etc/pcmcia.conf) to install instead to /etc/conf.d as the Gentoo-specific
     config
  4. Undid drobbins "-f" fix below, as it is not a very good default behavior,
     if , say, cardmgr starts dhcpcd, which can take a while to obtain
     information.  There is a CARDMGR_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/pcmcia where
     users can specify this if they want.
  5. I also put hermes.conf in ${FILESDIR}, but I am not installing it, as it
     causes cardmgr to choose the orinoco_cs driver over wvlan_cs, which may not
     be what the user wants.  It is documented pretty well that it must be
     downloaded, so I think it is safe to leave it out.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r3 (05 Mar 2002)

  05 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : 

  properly install the pcmcia rc script into /etc/init.d; add -f option 
  to cardmgr so that it stays in the foreground until it's done doing its 
  thing.  This ensures that any network interfaces are set up after it 
  detaches.  This closes bug #972.

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r2 (10 Feb 2002)

  10 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : 

  Configure --srctree option added to tell pcmcia-cs to configure for 
  kernel described in /usr/src/linux rather than the currently-running 
  kernel (which is otherwise the default). We're now doing this the "right"
  way. 

*pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
