  20 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r3.ebuild :
  Mark stable for all, as all issues are fixed, and 3.1.1-r2 with filefuncs
  did not seem to propagate properly.

  11 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r2.ebuild :
  Mark stable for all, as next baselayout will need a gawk with filefuncs.

*gawk-3.1.2-r3 (27 Mar 2003)

  26 Apr 2003; Christian Birchinger <joker@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r3.ebuild :
  Added stable sparc keyword

  17 Apr 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r3.ebuild :
  Changed x86 keywords

  27 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r3.ebuild :
  Special files like those in /proc, report themselves as regular files
  of length 0, when in fact they have data in them if you try to read them.
  The new record-reading code wasn't quite smart enough to deal with such
  a bizarre case.  The following patch fixes the problem, thanks to 
  Arnold D. Robbins (Maintainer of gawk).

*gawk-3.1.1-r2 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r2.ebuild :
  For some reason gawk-3.1.2 is more pain than worth.  Seems this release
  also borks the ability to specify input files as arguments:

    # gawk '/devfs/ { print }' /proc/filesystems 
    #

  should have been the same as:
  
    # cat /proc/filesystems | gawk '/devfs/ { print }'
    nodev	devfs
    nodev	usbdevfs
    # 

  Thus all this release does, is get the filefuncs module into 3.1.1 as well,
  so that we can totally mask gawk-3.1.2.

*gawk-3.1.2-r2 (25 Mar 2003)

  25 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r2.ebuild :
  Add filefuncs module from baselayout, as it is very closly tied to the gawk
  version running.  While we are at it, version the module (filefuncs.so.0.0.1,
  with soname of filefuncs.so.0 for now).  Do not install acconfig.h into
  /usr/include/awk, as it is redundant.  This should fix bug #18127.

*gawk-3.1.2-r1 (25 Mar 2003)

  25 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2-r1.ebuild :
  Version that should not really have hit portage, but I was busy at work
  and closing time caught me.

*gawk-3.1.2 (24 Mar 2003)

  24 Mar 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2.ebuild :
  -* keyword, and get the -r1 ebuild stuff that I somehow ignored into it, a -r1
  which will be ~ rather than - will be forthcoming

  24 Mar 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.2.ebuild :
  Bump

  20 Feb 2003; Zach Welch <zwelch@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  Added arm to keywords.

  08 Feb 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  Added hppa to keywords.

*gawk-3.1.1-r1 (20 Dec 2002)

  20 Dec 2002; Jan Seidel <tuxus@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  Added mips to keywords

  16 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gawk-3.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  Fix rare case where gawk do not get installed as /bin/gawk-$PV, but
  rather /bin/gawk-.  Fix missing docs.
