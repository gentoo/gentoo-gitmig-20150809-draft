*fileutils-4.1.11-r1 (12 Dec 2002)

  12 Dec 2002; Joachim Blaabjerg <styx@gentoo.org> fileutils-4.1.11-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-fileutils-4.1.11-r1, ChangeLog :

  Readded the ACL support, ditched xdelta (what's the point of using that
  anyway?) and forward-ported the 4.1.8 patch to 4.1.11, masked for testing.
  Fixes bug #11936

\* Autoupdate keywords (12-6-02)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> fileutils-4.1.8.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  04 May 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> fileutils-4.1.8-r2.ebuild:

  ACL/NLS fix patch should only be applied if ACL support is actually
  being compiled in.  Bumping rev so people don't keep trying to merge
  previous broken version.

*fileutils-4.1.8-r1 (02 May 2002)

  03 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added acl.c.diff to fix
  compilation with nls disabled.  Blocke is sending this fix upstream to
  acl.bestbits.at.  No rev bump -- no need for a recompile if it worked for
  people.

  02 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Added ACL support, closing
  bug #2343 (USE="acl" must be set)

*fileutils-4.1.8 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : New release that fixes
  a not-so-great "mv" bug.

*fileutils-4.1.4-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
