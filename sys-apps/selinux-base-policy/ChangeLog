*selinux-base-policy-20030603 (03 Jun 2003)

  03 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030603.ebuild:
  Numerous various fixes. Added staff role. Removed ipsec, gpm and gpg policies
  as they are not appropriate for the base policy, and untested.

*selinux-base-policy-20030522 (22 May 2003)

  22 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030522.ebuild:
  The policy is in pretty good shape now. I've been able to run in enforcing mode
  with little problem. I've also been able to successfully merge and unmerge
  packages in enforcing mode, with few exceptions (why does mysql need to run ps
  during configure?).

*selinux-base-policy-20030514 (14 May 2003)

  14 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030514.ebuild:
  Many improvements in many areas. Of note, rlogind policies were removed. Klogd
  is being merged into syslogd. The portage policy is much more complete, but
  still needs work. Its suggested that all changes be merged in, policy
  reloaded, then relabel.
