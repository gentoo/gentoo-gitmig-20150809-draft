  Amazing what happens if I report bugs to the right places for us :)
  This release should fix the %CPU reporting, AND the 3 eating bug,

  can start pushing to move this to stable :)

  to top, apparently we weren't the only ones annoyed about it.  
  Keep me updated on quirkiness in this version! :)

  Bump, still unstable, hopefully Albert will fix the issues people are
  having... please let me know about the quirkyness of the new top.

*procps-3.1.0 (16 Nov 2002)

  16 Nov 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> procps-3.1.0.ebuild :

  Well this should be an interesting experiment.  I'm putting into
  unstable the most recent procps from the sf.net procps project.  This
  procps tree has some very nice new features, and SHOULD actually be
  more stable than the 2.0.X tree we were using which was maintained by
  Rik Van Riel.  The reason we waited until now for this move was that
  some of the features of the gentoo-sources and development-sources
  kernels weren't supported by this procps, HOPEFULLY the sf.net project
  will continue from here on to keep up with support for the latest
  kernel features AND remainthe more stable tree.  

  Of course I also did my usual round of ebuild cleanups that goes 
  with a major version bump.  Enjoy.

  05 Nov 2002; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> procps-2.0.10-r1.ebuild :
