# Select here if you want dynamic or static speed
# If you select static you should use the battery.sh script
# provided with this ebuild to control speed depending on A/C status
# acceptable values:
#	powersave       maximise power savings
#	performance     maximise performance
#	dynamic         adjust speed according to CPU load (default)
#	NNN             set CPU to a fixed speed of NNN MHz
#	auto            let the init script detect current battery status
SPEEDFREQ_SPEED="auto"

# If you want normal users to be able to control the speed
# Default is to only allow root
