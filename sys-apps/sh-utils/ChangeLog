  Tweaked patch so 'uname -a' on MIPS systems accurately displays cpuinfo
  It looked for "processor" when it should be looking for "cpu model" in /proc/cpuinfo

  20 Feb 2003; Zach Welch <zwelch@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.15.ebuild :
  Not applying patch for arm because it breaks uname.
  Added arm to keywords.

  04 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  files/sh-utils-2.0.15-gentoo.diff :

  upgraded the diff with Carlos's new version which he e-mailed to me today.
  The second "unknown" is now gone.

  27 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  files/sh-utils-2.0.15-gentoo.diff :

  upgraded the diff to Carlos Georges' version. Still in beta, so more
  updates to that patch expected.

  24 Aug 2002; Joachim Blaabjerg <styx@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.15.ebuild :

  Version bump, finally wrote a new uname.c patch. Even looks like it works.
  Fixes bug #6579, masked for testing.

*sh-utils-2.0.14 (14 Aug 2002)

  14 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.14.ebuild :

  Version bump, as requested by: klebermass@limtec.de (Martin Klebermass) in
  bug #6035.  The uname function has undergone some changes, so while this
  is masked for testing, I am waiting for a patch from Carlos for uname.

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r5 (21 Jun 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  files/sh-utils-2.0.11-gentoo.patch :

  Added one line to the Carlos E Gorges <carlos@techlinux.com.br> patch to
  show correct output for ppc as well.

  21 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Remove /usr/bin/hostname to install if "build" in USE, as it do not get
  removed during "emerge system", and breaks some packages (gnome2 among
  things).

  06 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : updated the mtime of
  src/uname.c in order to thwart a perl dependency (bad mtime was triggering
  man page regeneration, creating a perl dep and breaking new build image
  creation)

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r4 (20 Mar 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r4.ebuild :
  Added LICENSE, KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  20 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r4.ebuild :

  Found an updated patch for processor name in uname output from digiwano in
  #fluxbox and LKML.  New patch in ${FILESDIR} combines this and the rant-patch.
  Now this should compile cleanly with "-* build" as well as normally.

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r3 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r3.ebuild :

  fascism.

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sh-utils-2.0.11-r2.ebuild :

  Added a patch to uname.c from the nuname package.  This allows display in the
  uname output of more kinds of processors (AuthenticAMD, Cyrix, and possibly
  Alpha, even though Gentoo does not exist for Alphas yet :).

*sh-utils-2.0.11-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
