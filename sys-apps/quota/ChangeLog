  Mark stable on alpha

*quota-3.06 (9 Dec 2002)

  05 Jan 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> quota-3.06-r1.ebuild :

  NLS bloat reduction.  The upstream configure script needs to take care of

  Added rc script from gregg@unix.net to -r1, and masked it for testing.

  3 Dec 2002; Joachim Blaabjerg <styx@gentoo.org> quota-3.03.ebuild
  quota-3.04.ebuild :

  Removed old ebuilds. I assumed it was safe, as none of them were keyworded
  any different than 3.06, so I assumed they were obsolete. Kick me in the
  nuts if I'm wrong.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
