*iproute-20010824-r1 (04 Aug 2002)

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> New ebuild with htb3
  support, which is now always enabled.  We include a "pkt_sched.h" Linux
  kernel header in our patch that has been htb3-enabled.  This allows us to
  always be able to compile-in htb3 support, even if the local kernel sources
  don't include such support; this closes bugs #5780, #6018.

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> We now install Debian's man
  pages which are strangely absent from Debian's binary package.
