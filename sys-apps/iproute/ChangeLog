  10 Feb 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> *.ebuild :

  Changed sed expression delimiters from / to :, closing bug #15006 by Blu3
  <david+gentoo.org@blue-labs.org>.  Also, moved the patches from files/ to
  the mirrors.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
  22 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> iproute-20010824-r2.ebuild :

  This should fix the issues people are having with htb3, just resyncs
  with the latest patch from debian, which is known to work, briefly
  in the unstable profile (bug 9329).

*iproute-20010824-r1 (30 Aug 2002)

  05 Oct 2002; Jack Morgan <jmorgan@gentoo.org> :
  Added sparc/sparc64 to keywords.

  30 Aug 2002; Sascha Schwabbauer <cybersystem@gentoo.org> :
  Added ppc to keywords.

*iproute-20010824-r1 (04 Aug 2002)

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> New ebuild with htb3
  support, which is now always enabled.  We include a "pkt_sched.h" Linux
  kernel header in our patch that has been htb3-enabled.  This allows us to
  always be able to compile-in htb3 support, even if the local kernel sources
  don't include such support; this closes bugs #5780, #6018.

  04 Aug 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> We now install Debian's man
  pages which are strangely absent from Debian's binary package.

*iproute-20010824 (09 Jul 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> iproute-20010824.ebuild : Added
  KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  09 Jul 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> ChangeLog : Added ChangeLog.
