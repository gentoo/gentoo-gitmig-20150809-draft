The Gentoo Linux Cron README
============================
  
  - To be able to use cron a user must be part of the cron group.

  - Crontabs are placed in /var/spool/cron/crontabs (fcron: /var/spool/cron/fcrontabs )

  - Each cron takes care of running /etc/cron.{hourly|daily|weekly|montly}. Vixie 
  Cron does this via the system crontab /etc/crontab - the others must have a 
  root crontab that takes care of this.

  - Only one cron per system.

  - dcron is "default"
