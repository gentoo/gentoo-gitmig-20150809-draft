*shadow-4.0.2-r4.ebuild (14 July 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-4.0.2-r4.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

*shadow-4.0.1-r2.ebuild (14 July 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-4.0.1-r2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  29 Jun 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>
  Update to use libtool.eclass.  This fix the compile problems without
  having custom $LIBS and $LDFLAGS.

*shadow-4.0.2-r5 (28 Apr 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-4.0.2-r5.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS.

  28 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>

  Remove /etc/login.defs.

  8 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>

  Removed /bin/login in favour of the one in util-linux, as the one
  included here have a root exploit if pam_limits is in use.

  Libtoolized to fix .la files.  Build is pretty broken if libtoolized, so had
  to put a unortodox LIBS= and LDFLAGS= there.

*shadow-4.0.3 (3 Apr 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-4.0.3.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS.

  3 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org>

  Added new shadow version, currently masked out until it's been
  tested better.
	
*shadow-4.0.2-r3 (3 Apr 2002)

  3 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org>

  Cleaned up earlier fix to account for all possibilities, such as
  binary packages, different ROOT's, and an already existing good
  system-auth file.
	
*shadow-4.0.2-r2 (3 Apr 2002)

  3 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org>

  Fixed /etc/pam.d/system-auth to use pam_unix instead of pam_pwdb due
  to security bug.
  
*shadow-4.0.2-r1 (25 Mar 2002)

  25 Mar 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>

  Fix the "libdir" in /usr/lib/libmisc.la.

*shadow-20001016-r10 (12 Mar 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r10.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> 

  Added USE dependent nls compilation.

*shadow-20001016-r9 (26 Feb 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r9.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  26 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r9.ebuild, login.defs

  Changed 'CREATE_HOME yes' to 'CREATE_HOME no' in login.defs.
  CREATE_HOME is a RedHat'ism and is not supported by the stock shadow
  package (see src/useradd.c).  When CREATE_HOME is set to 'yes',
  adduser generates a warning meassage. 

  Bumped ebuild revision so login.defs will be updated by emerge updates.
  
  Note to users:  'useradd -m <user>' will create the home directory and
  add any files in /etc/skel (see 'man adduser')
  

*shadow-20001016-r8 (25 Feb 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r8.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  25 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r8.ebuild

  Added a 'rm -rf ${D}/usr/share/man/*' to Chris's man fix to clean the
  Polish pages.  Added the line for installing /etc/pam.d/chage again, which
  should close bug #837.

*shadow-20001016-r7 (20 Feb 2002)

  14 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r7.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, SLOT.

  20 Feb 2002; Chris Houser <chouser@gentoo.org> shadow-20001016-r7.ebuild
  files/digest-shadow-20001016-r7 ChangeLog :

  Changed man page installation.  More man pages are now included, and all
  should be in English (instead of the occasional Polish page).  This closes
  bug #594.

*shadow-20001016-r6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
