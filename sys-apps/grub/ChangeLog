  Add the latest version thanks to good work from (bug #4020)
  Markus Krainer <markus-krainer@chello.at>.  Slotified the lot,
  as well as move splash.xpm.gz to ${FILESDIR}/, as having three
  seems a bit much.

*grub-0.90-r6 (4 Feb 2002)
*grub-0.91-r1 (4 Feb 2002)

  4 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: grub-0.90-r6.ebuild,
  grub-0.91-r1.ebuild: unset CFLAGS to ensure that GRUB code is i486-compatible,
  a good thing for a boot loader.  Upgraded /boot mounting code to be compatible
  with systems without a dedicated /boot filesystem.  Tweaked GRUB installation
  so that the /boot/grub/*stage* files don't get overwritten, since this could
  mess up the currently-in-the-MBR GRUB.  These fixes also close bug #527.

  4 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> grub-0.90-r5.ebuild, grub-0.91.ebuild :  
  Added new setup function which detects if /boot is mounted or not, in case
  it's not mounted it will try to do it automatically and in case of a failure
  exit with an error message.

*grub-0.90-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
