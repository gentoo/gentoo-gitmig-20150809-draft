  7 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Move /etc/init.d/depscan.sh, /etc/init.d/runscript.sh and
  /etc/init.d/functions.sh to /sbin to ensure that they are updated correctly.

  Other minor bug fixes, check the Changelog.

*baselayout-1.7.6 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  As rc-scripts-1.3.1 was pretty much still in the works, "before" and "after"
  order deps was pretty broken.  This release fix this along with a few other
  minor bugfixes.

  24 Mar 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  baselayout-1.7.4* used copies of depscan.sh and functions.sh in ${FILESDIR} to
  fix problems, and this was forgotten to be taken out in 1.7.5*.

*baselayout-1.7.5-r1 (23 Mar 2002)

  23 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : Jim Nutt pointed out that
  his /etc/inittab kept on getting overwritten after every new baselayout merge.
  Investigated and found many illegal things being done in pkg_postinst(), which
  are now hopefully fixed.

*baselayout-1.7.5 (23 Mar 2002)

  23 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : New release with several
  rc-script bug fixes; see /usr/share/doc/baselayout-1.7.5/ChangeLog.gz for more
  info (this new baselayout includes rc-scripts-1.3.1)
  
  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Update the pkg_postinst() stuff to use the build USE flag when doing stuff
  that really should not be done during bootstrap.

  Add support for the "bootstrap" USE flag.

  20 March 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : fixed pkg_postinst()
  that was changing dirs to ${D}/dev instead of ${ROOT}/dev.  No rev bump.
  
  20 March 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : tweaked ebuild to test
  for devfs mount by looking for /dev/.devfsd, not by catting /proc/mounts.
  Catting /proc/mounts can give inaccurate results if you're inside a chroot
  and your "outside" root has devfs enabled (which is normally the case,
  really, since the CD uses devfs).  This should fix a problem where device
  nodes don't exist after bootstrap, which causes the sys-devel/perl build to
  fail since it cats stuff to /dev/null. (causes obscure "missing seperator
  in makefile, line 613" error).  No rev bump for this fix.

*baselayout-1.7.4-r2 (11 March 2002)

  11 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>
  baselayout-1.7.4-r2.ebuild, functions.sh : Fix functions.sh using
  /usr/bin/basename for users that have /usr on seperate partition.

*baselayout-1.7.4-r1 (11 March 2002)

  11 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>
  baselayout-1.7.4-r1.ebuild, depscan.sh : Fix bash error if no service
  "provide" a virtual service.

*baselayout-1.7.4 (10 March 2002)

  6 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r3.ebuild :

  Fix a bug where merging baselayout with 1.7.3-r1 already installed, would kill
  X when it was started with /etc/init.d/xdm.

  6 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r2.ebuild :

  Fixed the respawning "startDM.sh" process.  Fixed the fsck of / when rebooting
  for the first time after baselayout merge.

  5 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3-r1.ebuild :

  Update /etc/init.d/keymaps and /etc/init.d/consolefont to use the new
  sys-apps/kbd package.  More xdm fixes and safeguards in /sbin/rc.

  Added a "mkdir -p /etc/X11/" for if it do not exist.

*baselayout-1.7.3 (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.3.ebuild :

  Add updated xdm scripts to handle the "dead keys" bug. They should move to
  the xfree package when tested fully.

  Other minor ajustments.

*baselayout-1.7.2 (3 March 2002)

  3 March 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.2.ebuild :

  Lots of updates and fixes, check /usr/share/doc/baselayout-1.7.2/ChangeLog
  for details.

*baselayout-1.7.1-r2 (25 Feb 2002)

  25 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1-r2.ebuild :

  Change devices to be created in ${D}/dev and not ${D}/lib/dev-state, as they
  are for use only when devfs is not used.

*baselayout-1.7.1-r1 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1-r1.ebuild:
  moved MAKEDEV device node creation to pkg_postinst() so that device nodes don't
  get recorded in CONTENTS.  Latest CVS Portage no longer records device nodes
  in CONTENTS since there's generally no point or clean way to unmerge them.

*baselayout-1.7.1 (6 Feb 2002)

  6 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> baselayout-1.7.1.ebuild :

  Move rc-scripts.tar.bz2 to CVS.  Remove forcefull install of /etc/devfsd.conf.

*baselayout-1.7.0-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
