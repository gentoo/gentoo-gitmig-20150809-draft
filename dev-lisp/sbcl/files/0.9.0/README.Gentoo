Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for SBCL
----------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/ directory.

  * The Gentoo port uses patches from the Debian project's SBCL port.

  * An SBCL with support for multi-threading on GNU/Linux for x86 is available
    with 'USE="threads" emerge dev-lisp/sbcl'

  * asdf-install is installed as sbcl-asdf-install (the man-page is similarly
    named).

  * Support for the Common Lisp Controller is available.

  * If "nosource" is in your USE flags, then SBCL's source will not be installed
    (in /usr/lib/sbcl/src).

  * If "unicode" is in your USE flags, then support for SBCL
    Unicode will be included.

  * If "ldb" is in your USE flags, then support for the SBCL low-level debugger
    will be included.

  * If "callbacks" is in your USE flags, then support for foreign callbacks will
    be included.  This is useful for libraries such as Lambda-GTK.  
 
    NOTE: callback support is implemented using Thomas Burdick's SBCL-AF patch
    which is distributed outside of SBCL.  This will NOT be the final API SBCL
    uses.  See also:

        http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/4341

    Ports which require callbacks in SBCL:

        cl-zeroconf
	lambda-gtk

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use http://bugs.gentoo.org.
Please don't bother the upstream authors unless you are absolutely certain it is
not Gentoo-related.
