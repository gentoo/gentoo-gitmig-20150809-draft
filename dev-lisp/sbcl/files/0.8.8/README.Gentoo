Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for SBCL
----------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/
directory.

  * The Gentoo port uses patches from the Debian project's SBCL port.

  * An SBCL with support for multi-threading on GNU/Linux for x86 is
    available with 'USE="threads" emerge dev-lisp/sbcl'

  * asdf-install is installed as sbcl-asdf-install (the man-page is
    similarly named).

  * Support for the Common Lisp Controller is available.

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use
http://bugs.gentoo.org.  Please don't bother the upstream authors
unless you are absolutely certain it is not Gentoo-related.
