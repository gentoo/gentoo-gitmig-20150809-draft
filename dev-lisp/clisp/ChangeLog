  From the web page:

  Common Lisp is a high-level, all-purpose, object-oriented, dynamic,
  functional programming language.

  CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible, then of Karlsruhe
  University, and Michael Stoll, then of Munich University, both in
  Germany. It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp
  standard.

  CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a
  foreign language interface and a socket interface. An X11 interface is
  available through CLX and Garnet. Command line editing is provided by
  readline.

  CLISP runs on microcomputers (OS/2, Windows 95/98/2000/NT, Amiga
  500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (GNU/Linux,
  BSD, SVR4, Sun4, DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and
  others) and needs only 2 MB of RAM.

  CLISP is Free Software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU
  GPL. You may distribute commercial applications compiled with CLISP, see
  file COPYRIGHT in the CLISP distribution.

  The user interface comes in German, English, French, Spanish and Dutch,
  and can be changed at run time.
