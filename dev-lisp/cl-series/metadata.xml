  This is Richard C. Waters' SERIES package for Common Lisp.

  A series is a data structure much like a sequence, with similar
  kinds of operations. The difference is that in many situations,
  operations on series may be composed functionally and yet execute
  iteratively, without the need to construct intermediate series
  values explicitly. In this manner, series provide both the clarity
  of a functional programming style and the efficiency of an iterative
  programming style.
