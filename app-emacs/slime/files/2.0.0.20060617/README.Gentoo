SLIME notes for Gentoo
----------------------

If you're interested in hacking this ebuild, Gentoo uses its own
swank.asd system definition file and swank-loader.lisp.

As always with CVS ebuilds, DO NOT report problems to upstream.
Always report problems to the Gentoo Bugzilla at
http://bugs.gentoo.org/.
