  09 Dec 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> smarteiffel-1.0.ebuild, files/digest-smarteiffel-1.0 :

  smarteiffel-1.0 released, version update. Changes to ebuild (by Per Wigren <wigren@home.se>):
  * Support for TinyCC as default compiler using "tcc"-useflag.   - problematic at the moment, commented uot (George)
  * Added a SE_DIR environment-variable so all extra-packages can depend on it.
  * Changed SE_DIR to /usr/lib/SmartEiffel, because that is the default dir if the
  SmartEiffel-variable is not set, and a few 3rd-party-packages expect it.
  * Don't rename compile to se-compile anymore! This breaks ALL 3rd-party-packages!
  * SmartEiffel is now distributed with versionnumbered filenames so there's no
  need to rename+mirror anymore! ;)

  22 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> smarteiffel-1.0_beta5.ebuild, files/digest-smarteiffel-1.0_beta5 :
  cleaned up and committed to portage.

  22 Nov 2002; Steven Wong <wongs15@tartarus.uwa.edu.au> :
  - Fixed empty loadpath.UNIX being generated.
  - lib/ and tools/ directories are installed now.
  - Fixed links in html documentation; they don't reference to "../man"
    anymore.

  16 Nov 2002; Steven Wong <wongs15@tartarus.uwa.edu.au> :
  Ebuild submitted by me. There is still some murky places
  standard-wise, but I think it's better to leave this mostly for the
  SmartEiffel developers to clean out. Big thanks to George Shapovalov
  <george@gentoo.org> who did all the researching to find how other
  distributions packaged this strange beast. :)
