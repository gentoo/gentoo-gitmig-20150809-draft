  Unmasked.

  09 Jan 2003; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> stratego-0.8.1.ebuild:
  Added a fix by styx to make it compile properly.

  09 Jan 2003; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> : masked 0.8 for
  testing again. It has a minor bug in its build system that needs to fixed.

  it.

  11 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> stratego-0.7.ebuild files/digest-stratego-0.7:

  Stratego is a modular language for the specification of fully automatic 
  program transformation systems based on the paradigm of RewritingStrategies.

  In Stratego, basic transformation rules are expressed by means of labeled 
  conditional rewrite rules. Exhaustively applying all rewrite rules in a 
  collection of valid rules is often not desirable; a system of rules can be 
  non-terminating, or, more frequently, non-confluent. The latter means that 
  different outcomes of the normalization process are possible depending on 
  the position of application and the selection of rules. Therefore, it is
  necessary to have more control over the application of rules. In standard 
  systems based on rewriting, normalization is controlled by a fixed default 
  RewritingStrategy. In such systems more control is achieved by encoding the 
  desired strategy with additional rewrite rules that spell out a traversal 
  over the abstract syntax tree and apply the transformations in the desired 
  order.
