*ghc-5.04.ebuild (08 Aug 2002)

  19 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ghc-5.04.ebuild :

  fixed header, added >=dev-libs/gmp-4.1 dependency

  08 Jul 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ghc-5.04.ebuild, files/ghc-5.04-gentoo.patch.bz2 :

  new version,
  bzipped patched (too large otherwise),
  will keep uncompressed for 5.02.3 anc compressed for 5.04 until new version 
  is tested (to have one working meanwhile)

  ebuild (and large patching work) submitted by:
  Sven Moritz Hallberg <pesco@gmx.de>

*ghc-5.02.3.ebuild (09 Jun 2002)

  18 Jun 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ghc-5.02.3.ebuild :

  Few improvements by Sven Moritz Hallberg :
  Build DocBook documentation only if USEing 'doc'. Require DocBook DTD 3.1 in
  that case.

  Thanks to a bug report by Matthew Walton I've noticed that GHC requires the
  DocBook DTD 3.1, not 4.1.

  First submission
  From the home page:

  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler 
  and interactive environment for Haskell 98, GHC compiles Haskell to either 
  native code or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions 
  to Haskell 98; for example: concurrency, a foreign language interface, 
  multi-parameter type classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal 
  quantification, unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on.  GHC comes 
  with a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler.
