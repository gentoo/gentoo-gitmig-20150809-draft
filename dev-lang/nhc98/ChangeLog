  First submission
  From the home page:

  nhc98 is a fully-fledged compiler for Haskell 98, the standard lazy functional 
  programming language. Written in Haskell, it is small and very portable, 
  and aims to produce small executables that run in small amounts of memory. 
  Is a pattern becoming obvious here? :-) It also comes with extensive tool 
  support for automatic compilation, foreign language interfacing, 
  heap and time profiling, tracing, and debugging.
