*icc-8.0.055 (07 Feb 2004)

  07 Feb 2004; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> icc-8.0.055.ebuild:
  New ebuild, partially rewritten from bug #35602. This ebuild is still
  "iffy" and needs some work as I'm trying to get back to the rpm eclass
  but haven't incorporated fixes from the most recent ebuild submission
  on bugzilla. Thanks to Jeremy Warren for this ebuild as well as
  everyone who helped.

  15 Oct 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.030.ebuild :
  Fix rpm_unpack call again.

*icc-7.1.030 (13 Oct 2003)

  13 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.030.ebuild:
  New icc version for people with a premier.intel.com account. ~ on 
  x86 and ia64.

  24 Sep 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild :
  Fix rpm_unpack call, bug 29484.

  18 Sep 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild,
  icc-7.1.029.ebuild :
  _Much_ faster unpacking thanks to rpm.eclass and Georgi Georgiev.
  See bug 23179 for more information.

*icc-7.1.029 (18 Sep 2003)

  18 Sep 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.029.ebuild:
  new version marked stable for ia64, unstable for x86. ia64 support
  integrated into this ebuild. Also switched to slower rpm2targz simply
  because it doesn't require "rpm" to be merged.

*icc-7.1.006 (11 April 2003)

  11 April 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild :

  Version bump.

  25 May 2003; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.1.006.ebuild :

  Added icpc wrapper.

*icc-7.0.065-r2 (20 Dec 2002)

  20 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065-r2.ebuild :

  Fixed 05icc-ifc to include INTEL_LICENSE_FILE. Bug found by Zadeh
  (garen@garen.net).

*icc-7.0.065-r1 (11 Dec 2002)

  11 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065-r1.ebuild :

  Changed the "icc" wrapper script to properly translate gcc CFLAGS into
  icc CFLAGS.

*icc-7.0.065 (10 Dec 2002)

  10 Dec 2002; Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.065.ebuild :

  Changed the naming to more accurately reflect the current ICC
  version number. Also fixed the primary executable and added a warning
  about compiling important applications with icc.

  8 Dec 2002 Jon Portnoy <avenj@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Added a warning about the behavior of the main executable.
  'icc' will return errors; 'iccbin' works fine.
 
  Fixed the warning messages to fit a standard terminal.

  Fixed the old version checking statement to avoid matching
  the current version.

  5 Dec 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Included some improvments from Jon Portnoy from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11211

*icc-7.0
  25 Nov 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-7.0.ebuild :

  Basicly just updated the icc-6.0-r1 with new urls and changed the message at the end.

*icc-6.0-r1 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-6.0-r1.ebuild :

  Fixed a problem where I missed a place a file needs to be sed'ed during the
  install. Change 05icc to 05icc-ifc because both the icc-6 and ifc-6 packages
  used the same env info and I didn't want duplicate data.

*icc-6.0 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002  William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> icc-6.0.ebuild :

  The icc-6.0.ebuild is functionally identical to the icc-5.0.1.ebuild . A few
  tweaks were made for the minor differeces in Intel's package.

*icc-5.0.1 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Initial Gentoo package. The install from Intel is RPM based so I extract
  the i386 RPMs manually using rpm2cpio and cpio. (Idea taken from the
  realplayer ebuild) Other than running rpm for you the install script just
  replaces some stings in a few files with sed, so I copied and mangled the
  relavent lines from their install and use them. I also correct a typo
  descriped on Intel's web site. This fix should be removed at next icc upgrade.
  The install is a simple copy and adding one file to /etc/env.d to set up a few
  enviroment settings icc needs. After the package is merged I inform the user
  where to get a license key and where to put it.
