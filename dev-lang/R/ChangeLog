*R-1.5.1-ebuild (11 July 2002)

  09 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> R-1.5.1.ebuild :

  fixed the wrappers:
  R installs two identical wrappers (R that invoke R.bin) under /usr/bin and 
  /usr/lib/R/bin/. Only one of these was modified to have correct R_HOME_DIR
  Changed ebuild to modify R under /usr/lib/R/bin and symlink it into /usr/bin

*R-1.4.1 (19 Feb 2002)

  19 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, R-1.4.1.ebuild :
  
  Initial commit. R is GNU S - A language and environment for statistical
  computing and graphics. Gnome and tcltk gui's are available if in USE.
  
  If gnome, a rudimentary menu entry is made under Applications.
  However, it has the annoying tendency to pop up a terminal window to start
  the gui. (todo 1)  
  
  Also, the html files are not accessible from the toolbar menu entry unless
  you happen to be running netscape. (todo 2)
  
  This ebuild makes use of a new USE variable, 'atlas', which will compile
  R using the auto-tuned blas libraries provided by atlas. NOTE: atlas ebuild
  currently only provides static libraries. Shared libraries are in the works.
