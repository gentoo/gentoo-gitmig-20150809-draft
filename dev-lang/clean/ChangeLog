  "
  A Functional Programming Language like Clean is based on the concept
  of mathematical functions. Clean is a pure functional language, there
  is not such a thing as an assignment. This has a big advantage: a
  function cannot have a side-effect. A Clean function is referential
  transparent: the result of a function only depends on the value of
  the function arguments and on nothing else.

  This has important consequences:
    o Once a function is working, it will always work. A functionwill
      always react in the same way, regardless when and in which context
      the function is used;
    o One can reason about Clean functions and the Clean program as a
      whole (which is a function application) by using traditional
      mathematical reasoning: uniform substitution and mathematical
      induction.

  For making real world applications one needs of course to be able to
  update a database, perform I/O, update an array destructively, pass a
  message to another program. And, the application should run
  efficiently enough. Although Clean does not have assignments, objects
  can be updated destructively. Clean is the only functional language in
  the world which has a special type system, uniqueness typing. This
  type system is developed in Nijmegen. It enables to update function
  arguments destructively retaining the purity of the language.
