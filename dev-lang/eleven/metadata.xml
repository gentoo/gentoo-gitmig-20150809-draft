  <longdescription> Eleven is a programming language for creating robust,
	scalable Web applications quickly and easily. It offers a 20x programmer
	productivity increase over traditional server programming languages like
	ASP, PHP, and JSP by automating state management and taking control of the
	application's look and feel. From high-level source code with a simple,
	C-like syntax, the compiler generates complete, ready-to-run
	implementations in PHP or mod_perl. Applications maintain their state in a
	relational database and are inherently fault-tolerant, secure, and
	scalable.
