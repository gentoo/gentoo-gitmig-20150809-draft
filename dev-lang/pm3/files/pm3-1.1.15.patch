+The bulk of the distribution originates from DEC SRC and allows free

+claims of damage arising from your possession or use or inability to use the

+Description: Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3
+ The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based
+ on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment.
+ .
+ Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa,
+ Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+. It also resembles its cousins Object
+ Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
+ .
+ The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
+ meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Instead of exploring new
+ features, they studied the features of the Modula family of languages
+ that have proven themselves in practice and tried to simplify them into
+ a harmonious language. They found that most of the successful features
+ were aimed at one of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler,
+ more systematic type system.
+ .
+ Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
+ provision for explicit interfaces between modules. It adds objects and
+ classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes
+ (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.
+ .
+ A large number of platform independent libraries are available for easily
+ constructing distributed, graphical, multi-threaded applications.

+ The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based
+ on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment.  This package contains
+ the static link libraries needed to build standalone executables.
+
+Package: netobjd
+Section: net
+Architecture: i386
+Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, libpm3, libpm3-extra
+Description: the Network Object agent daemon
+ The Network Objects package provides a simple but powerful facility for
+ remote method invocation in the context of Modula-3.  Under Network
+ Objects, all subtypes of the object type NetObj.T are treated specially
+ in that they can be passed to remote address spaces by reference.  This
+ remote reference appears at the destination as a surrogate object which
+ is a subtype of the original object type.  If the original type has
+ methods, these methods can be remotely invoked through the surrogate.
+
+Package: obliq
+Section: interpreters
+Architecture: i386
+Recommends: netobjd
+Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, libpm3, libpm3-extra
+Description: An interactive interpreter for the Obliq language.
+ Obliq is a small, statically scoped, untyped language. It is object-oriented,
+ higher-order, and distributed. State is local to an address space, while
+ computation can migrate over the network. The distributed computation
+ mechanism is based on Modula-3 Network Objects.
+ .
+ This package includes several versions of Obliq:
+  obliq:         Obliq interpreter
+  obliq-3D:      Obliq interpreter with full 3D animation support
+  obliq-anim:    Obliq interpreter with full animation support
+  obliq-min:     Obliq interpreter with minimal runtime hooks
+  obliq-std:     Obliq interpreter with the standard runtime hooks
+  obliq-ui:      Obliq interpreter with ui support
+  obliqsrv:      Obliq server
+  obliqsrv-std:  Obliq server with the standard runtime hooks
+  obliqsrv-ui:   Obliq server with ui support
+  visobliq:      Prototype of an easy-to-use distributed programming
+                 environment using Obliq
+
+Package: mentor
+Section: graphics
+Architecture: i386
+Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, obliq, libpm3, libpm3-extra, netobjd
+Description: A collection of algorithm animations
+ Mentor encapsulates the Zeus animation library for Modula-3 into a single
+ application. Zeus itself is not very well documented, but a summary of the
+ animations which are part of the mentor application is available at:
+ .
