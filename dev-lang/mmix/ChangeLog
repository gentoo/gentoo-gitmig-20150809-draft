  From Knuth's page:

  MMIX is a machine that operates primarily on 64-bit words. It has 256 
  general-purpose 64-bit registers that each can hold either fixed-point or 
  floating-point numbers. Most instructions have the 4-byte form `OP X Y Z', 
  where each of OP, X, Y, and Z is a single 8-bit byte. For example, if OP is 
  the code for ADD the meaning is ``X=Y+Z''; i.e., ``Set register X to the 
  contents of register Y plus the contents of register Z.'' The 256 possible 
  OP codes fall into a dozen or so easily remembered categories.

  The designers of important real-world processor chips (e.g., MIPS and 
  ALPHA) have helped me with the design of MMIX. So I'm excited about the 
  prospects.
