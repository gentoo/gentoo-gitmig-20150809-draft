  This is a python 2.1.3 ebuild that does *not* conflict with
  python 2.2.*
  Note that 99.9% of the people out there won't use it anyway,
  because 2.2 will always be selected as most recent. ;-)

  20 Jul 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org>: python-2.2.1-r2.ebuild

  Add "-lm" to the python-config script. Closes bug #4217.
  2.2.1-r2 has a 100% identical ebuild file to 2.2.1-r1, just the
  python-config file has changed.

  Add expat to build depends (except during bootstrap), use econf

  are build as shared on Linux as default.

  20 Jul 2002; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org>: python-2.2.1.ebuild
