  Hugs 98 is a functional programming system based on Haskell 98, the de facto
  standard for non-strict functional programming languages. Hugs 98 provides 
  an almost complete implementation of Haskell 98, including:

    * Lazy evaluation, higher order functions, and pattern matching.
    * A wide range of built-in types, from characters to bignums, and lists to
      functions, with comprehensive facilities for defining new datatypes and
      type synonyms.
    * An advanced polymorphic type system with type and constructor class 
      overloading.
    * All of the features of the Haskell 98 expression and pattern syntax 
      including lambda, case, conditional and let expressions, list 
      comprehensions, do-notation, operator sections, and wildcard, 
      irrefutable and `as' patterns.
    * An implementation of the main Haskell 98 primitives for monadic I/O, 
      with support for simple interactive programs, access to text files, 
      handle-based I/O, and exception handling.
    * An almost complete implementation of the Haskell module system. Hugs 98 
      also supports a number of advanced and experimental extensions including
      multi-parameter classes, extensible records, rank-2 polymorphism, 
      existentials, scoped type variables, and restricted type synonyms.
