  created virtual/ghc, added PROVIDE=virtual/ghc to the ebuild to make dev-lang/ghc bootstrap correctly
  and without unnecessary steps  (#10155)

  modified ebuild to add sparc support (sparc people, please test!)
  fixups to wrapper scripts

  14 Dec 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, ghc-bin-5.04.2.ebuild, files/digest-ghc-bin-5.04.2 :
  initial release
  Glasgow Haskell Compiler - binary package, prebuilt for i386
  
  ghc has been quite a mess as well as a long and resurce-hungry compile.
  This is a first step towards sorting things out. This is the binary installation of ghc, currently 
  for x86 only. It can be used to bootstrap ghc build from source. In fact it is *necessary* to use this 
  binary version to bootstrap ghc on >=gcc-3.2 systems. The old 4.08 ->5.04 way of bootstrapping fails 
  with gcc-3.2.
