  Added ppc to keywords

  03 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  : :

  New stability release.
  
  25 June 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> changelog:

  Fixed svgalib dep.  Was really to close bug #3161 (not 3104).  In that
  case the user had previously installed svgalib and noautounmadness.so linked
  against it.  have seen this in PPC land before as well,  If kdelibs is 
  built with svgalib (or any other lib) linked and you remove it you will run 
  into same problem if you don't rebuild the kdelibs after removing.
  Closes bug #4111
