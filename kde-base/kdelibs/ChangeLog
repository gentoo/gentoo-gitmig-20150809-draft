*kdelibs-3.0.3 (19 Aug 2002)

  19 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New bugfix release. Enjoy!

  02 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Narrow down arts dependencies: don't allow usage of a more recent version
  of arts than the one released with this kdelibs.

*kdelibs-3.0.2-r1 (16 Jul 2002)

  01 Aug 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> kde-3.0.2.ebuild :
  Added ppc to keywords

  16 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New version that works well with the latest eclass updates and is fully
  forward compatible with the kde 3.1_alpha1 ebuilds now in testing. Also
  removes the trick where kde style plugins were installed into the qt
  plugin dir (it raises issues with mutliple kde versions being installed;
  you can enable the faeture manually via qtconfig).

*kdelibs-3.0.2 (03 Jul 2002)

  01 Aug 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> kde-3.0.2.ebuild :
  Added ppc to keywords

  03 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  New stability release.

*kdelibs-3.0.1.20020604 (4 Jun 2002)

  4 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  This is a snapshot of the KDE CVS's KDE_3_0_x branch from June 6th.
  This branch contains only bugfixes to the 3.0 release (the 3.0.1 release
  was also of this kind).

  26 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  Cleanup deps.

*kdelibs-3.0.1 (24 May 2002)

  24 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  Bugfix release (KDE 3.0.1).

*kdelibs-3.0-r2 (11 May 2002)

  11 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :
  
  Make ${KDEDIR}/lib/kde3/plugins (where all style plugins live) a symlink to
  /usr/qt/3/plugins. That way qt-only apps can use kde styles with the default qtconfig
  setup. Closes bug #2118, too.

  2 May 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Add ghostscript dep (needed for printing to pdf).

  6 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Change cups dep to >=1.1.14.

*kdelibs-3.0-r1 (5 Apr 2002)

  5 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :
  
  Add --with-fast-malloc=full configure option for a considerable speed improvement.

*kdelibs-3.0 (4 Apr 2002)

  4 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog :

  KDE 3.0 ebuilds. Based on the well-tested kde3pre ebuild set.
  kdelibs-2.2.2-r4: added SLOT=2.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r4 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Split the env.d file into two, so that when both ked2 and kde3 are installed,
  the KDEDIR of kde3 gets exported (was the other way around till now).

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> kdelibs-2.2.2-r3.ebuild :

  HTML documentation is now done with dohtml instead of dodoc, so it will not
  get gzipped any longer.  This change is small as compared to the size of this
  package so the revision level for the ebuild was not bumped up.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r3 (22 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added KDEDIRS export to env.d file - will come in handy when several KDEs are
  installed side-by-side. If you're not into that kind of thing, you don't care
  about it and needn't upgrade.
  
  Added support for customizing kde install locations. You probably don't need it,
  in which case you don't want to hear about it. Note: untested support for now,
  but doesn't break anything else.

*kdelibs-2.2.2-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
