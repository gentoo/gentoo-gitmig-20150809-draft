* openmosix-user-0.3.-r2 (02 May 2003)

  02 May 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org>
  Official solution is to install openmosix.config into /etc/openmosix
  and to correct the init-script.

* openmosix-user-0.3.-r1 (01 May 2003)

  01 May 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org>
  Add sed magic to make sure openmosix.config get's installed into /etc and not into /etc/openmosix
  as the init script looks into /etc.

* openmosix-user-0.3 (12 Apr 2003)

  12 Apr 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org>
  Version bumped. Cleaned up the ebuild.

  31 Mar 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org>
  Version bumped to make sure autodiscovery works when used.
  That error was introduced with -r5 and discovered in #18372.

* openmosix-user-0.2.4-r5 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; Michael Imhof <tantive@gentoo.org>
  Version bumped to make sure everyone gets the new init script.
  Changed the name of the config file from /etc/mosix.map to
  /etc/openmosix.map. The ebuild will take care of moving old
  config files or install a new if no old one is present.
