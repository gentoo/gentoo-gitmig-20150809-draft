*mpich2-1.0.6 (03 Dec 2007)

  03 Dec 2007; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  +files/mpich2-1.0.6-cxx.patch, +files/mpich2-1.0.6-fPIC.patch,
  +files/mpich2-1.0.6-makefile.patch, +files/mpich2-1.0.6-shlib.patch,
  mpich2-1.0.5_p4.ebuild, +mpich2-1.0.6.ebuild:
  Updated to latest upstream release with pvfs2 support and shared lib fixes;
  this version actually has proper shared libraries and support for pvfs2, so
  feel free to test and report any problems.  Tested successfully with hdf5-
  parallel (but needs real cluster testing).

  10 Jul 2007; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.5_p4.ebuild:
  fixed a leftover development hack alertly noticed by Mr_Bones

*mpich2-1.0.5_p4 (09 Jul 2007)

  09 Jul 2007; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  +files/mpich2-1.0.5_p4-make.patch, +files/mpich2-1.0.5_p4-soname.patch,
  +mpich2-1.0.5_p4.ebuild:
  Updated to current version with major ebuild enhancements (it even builds
  with all USE flags now :)

  Note: the mpe-sdk flag requires a JDK and libX11, so it's really intended
  for a development workstation or at least a machine with an X desktop. The
  JDK parts of the ebuild could probably be improved, and it doesn't currently
  rebuild the jar files.  The docs handling is also hackish, but should Do The
  Right Thing (TM).  I'm pretty sure the upstream *.so config is whacked, and
  the current patch is about the best I can do right now.  Please enhance it.

  Test away...

  26 Apr 2007; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; metadata.xml:
  Update for cluster herd split to hp-cluster and ha-cluster.

  06 Dec 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild,
  mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Stop PROVIDEing mpi virtual, we're on a new-style virtual now.

  06 Dec 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild,
  mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Block all MPI providers.

  06 Dec 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild,
  mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Switch deps around so DEPEND is set to RDEPEND. This way, one could specify
  things that are only in DEPEND more easily, such as perl or coreutils. But I
  can't verify those now, so I'll leave it to someone else.

  06 Dec 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>;
  -mpich2-1.0.2_p1.ebuild:
  Clean up.

  26 Sep 2006; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Stable on SPARC wrt bug #133999.

  24 Sep 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>; mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild,
  mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  (#148719) Use WANT_AUTOCONF instead of need-autoconf() from
  kde-functions.eclass.

  28 Aug 2006; Donnie Berkholz <dberkholz@gentoo.org>;
  mpich2-1.0.2_p1.ebuild, mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild, mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  (#145367) Block media-sound/mpd and media-sound/mpd-svn, they also use
  mpd.conf and install /usr/bin/mpd.

  13 Jul 2006; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Mark 1.0.3-r1 ~ia64. #133999

  12 Jul 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Backported patches and install fixes to 1.0.3, but no other changes,
  since something rather subtle broke the hdf5 configure against 1.0.3-r1
  (but 1.0.3 relies heavily on configure detection for things like fortran
  support and doesn't yet have a test section).  Also added thread support.

  12 Jul 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  files/mpich2-1.0.3-soname.patch, mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Finally killed the soname bug, added some additional configure options,
  and made libaio a dependency for romio support (also fixed libaio).

  28 Jun 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  reverted to original (and standard) library location

*mpich2-1.0.3-r1 (26 Jun 2006)

  +files/mpich2-1.0.3-mpe-install.patch, +files/mpd.conf,
  +mpich2-1.0.3-r1.ebuild:
  Added explicit fortran and mpe-sdk support, test section, although
  tests still have a build issue with portage (only manual builds are
  currently working).  Feel free to add magic...

  25 Jun 2006; Markus Rothe <corsair@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Stable on ppc64; bug #133999

  17 Jun 2006; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Added ~sparc keyword wrt bug #133999.

  25 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Early stable bump for gdal (required).

  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Keyworded and tested on ppc, and as the older mpich was previously
  keyworded for both ppc and ppc64, I added them both back in.

*mpich2-1.0.3 (21 May 2006)

  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>
  +files/mpich2-1.0.3-make.patch, +files/mpich2-1.0.3-soname.patch,
  +mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Updated to new version (bug 125754) with patches; needed some help to
  create shared libs properly, along with some DESTDIR fixes (required for
  HDF5 dep, as virtual/mpi was barfing).

  +mpich2-1.0.2_p1.ebuild:
