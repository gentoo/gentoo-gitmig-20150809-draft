  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org> mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Keyworded and tested on ppc, and as the older mpich was previously
  keyworded for both, I added them back in.

*mpich2-1.0.3 (21 May 2006)

  21 May 2006; Steve Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>

  +mpich2-1.0.3.ebuild:
  Updated to new version (bug 125754) with patches; needed some help to
  create shared libs properly, along with some DESTDIR fixes (required for
  HDF5 dep, as virtual/mpi was barfing).
