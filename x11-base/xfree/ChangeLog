  05 May 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: xfree-4.3.0*.ebuild: moved
  "inherit" line below DEPEND definition, since the "newdepend" lines in the
  eclass were causing RDEPEND to get fried. RDEPEND should now be set
  correctly.

*xfree-4.3.0-r2 (08 Apr 2003)

  23 Apr 2003; Michael Fitzpatrick <leahcim@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Updated patch tarball to v1.1.3. Adds a tdfx patch to prevent a dri hang bug
  #19812. Allow X to auto use vc13(+) bug #19844.

  20 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Added TaD's three gentoo themes, changed the default cursor to core. Also,
  i18n fonts are built when "nls" is set in USE. and CJK fonts when both
  "nls" and "cjk" are set in USE.

  19 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Updated the patch tarball - this time to 1.1.1 -- this contains two more DRI
  patches for radeon -- one is Mesa, the other is a reinit patch

  15 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  changed default to core (black) pointer instead of whiteglass, at vlado's
  request.  The patch version is updated.  The previous patchset caused the
  compilation to fail on virgin systems (ie, those without X already
  installed).  Thanks to Bret Towe (Magnade in #gentoo-dev), the problem is
  fixed (the parallel make patch was a little wonky).  I want to express my
  thanks to lu_zero for helping out with the ATi stuff, the lads in #gentoo
  and the forums, and the chix0rs in #linuxchics for testing this
  extensively and pointing out my mistakes.  Please note that for this
  ebuild, Xinerama extensions on DRI enabled Radeon displays is disabled.  I
  will get to try and fixing this (one of the crucial patches for Radeon
  users disables this) for the more advanced users.  Everyone else -- enjoy!
  Also added newest SiS driver. Note that patch version is now 1.1.0

  15 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  moved fc-cache step to be the last font related stuff in postinst -- thanks to
  danarmak@gentoo.org <Dan Armak, king of KDE> for the fix

  14 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  upgrade to patch 1.0.8, which includes the fix for radeon/rage cards crashing
  with kdm logout. bug 94 on xfree's bugzilla has the oneliner patch from
  daenzer. The other option, apparently, is to make kdm actually restart x.
  Also, the ebuild now builds xfree with xft2 support -- thanks to
  foser@gentoo.org

  13 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  updated the PATCH to 1.0.7 -- the gb-xtt-enc patch (#063) was including header
  files from <X11/....> which indicates a need for a current installation of X.
  Ashmodai in #gentoo and Rroet in #gentoo-sparc discovered that it wouldn't
  compile on a system without X. Thanks to Ashmodai for testing the fix

  13 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Added patch 1.0.6 -- the gb stuff is now separated again, and more radeon
  patches from daenzer

  13 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild :

  Removed the generating koi8 fonts section thanks to Azarah :).  Also,
  added patches for radeon: first one that mharris pointed me to (a patch by
  daenzer, which fixes an issue with xcursors and xinerama); and a few more
  by daenzer that I found in his directory: http://penguinppc.org/~daenzer.
  Hopefully, this takes care of the issue where X crashes after logging out
  with kdm (using a radeon with drm/glx)

  12 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild,
  files/4.3.0/xfs.start :
  Add 'mkfontdirs' target for users that do not use xfs to be able to
  regenerate the font dirs.  Some small tweaks to the ebuild for corner
  cases.

  11 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild :

  The patch version is now 1.0.5.  Some redhat patches were added (the
  trivial and notable one is the die-die-die patch, which gets rid of the
  ugly initial checkerboard screen when X starts).  Also, the gb0830 patches
  were combined.  In previous tarball versions I had to add patches to undo
  duplicate effects.  The duplicate and undo patches are removed.
  Additionally, related patches have been combined.  Next stop -- xfree-drm

  08 Apr 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r2.ebuild,
  xfree-4.3.0.ebuild, xfree-4.3.0.ebuild:
  many fixes in this ebuild -- using the old keymaps from 4.2 to sort out the
  keymap situation. Added patches from Mandrake. Additionally, this uses
  Xwrapper so normal X binaries are not installed SUID. Added additional
  european fonts and asien fonts, and freetype encodings for X font server. The
  next -r version will have the ability to slim down the compile a little bit,
  and only install the drivers needed

  24 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.1-r2.ebuild,
                                                    xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild :
  Update SiS driver to version 210303-1, bug #18069.

  20 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.1-r2.ebuild :
  Unset MAKE_OPTS here as well, closing bug #17102

  10 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild :
  Add back Drobbins's fix that was dropped by mistake.  Move DRI patch
  to X_PATCHES as this was what its intended for.  Remove fc-{cache,list}
  from /usr/X11R6/bin.

*xfree-4.3.0-r1 (09 Mar 2003)

  20 Mar 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild:
  Removed sparc kb patch as it breaks on xfree upgrades.

  20 Mar 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild,
  files/4.3.0-patches/XFree86-4.3.0-gentoo-sparc-kb.patch:
  Added XFree86-4.3.0-gentoo-sparc-kb.patch to fix the Ctrl+Alt+FKeys so that
  key sequence now works. Patch is applied after install.

  12 Mar 2003; Zach Welch <zwelch@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild:
  add arm keyword

  09 Mar 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild :
  Added ~hppa to keywords.

  09 Mar 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild:
  added a patch for sparc keyboards from the xfree86 mailing list:
  http://www.mail-archive.com/devel%40xfree86.org/msg01156.html

  09 Mar 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0-r1.ebuild:
  Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> added some fixes for radeon issues

  08 Mar 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> xfree-4.3.0.ebuild: unset
  MAKE_OPTS before "emake World," since MAKE_OPTS is an internal XFree86
  Makefile variable. If a user mistakenly defined MAKE_OPTS in /etc/make.conf
  (instead of MAKEOPTS,) then the build will silently die. Since this is hard
  to track down, I'm adding a preemptive fix to the ebuild.
  
  06 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.1-r2.ebuild :
  Fix savage driver unpacking in wrong dir, thanks to
  roma1390 <roma1390@uosis.mif.vu.lt>, bug #16794.

  #14534.

  15 Feb 2003; Hannes Mehnert <hannes@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.99.4.ebuild :

  bumped savage driver to 1.1.27t (prior versions do not work). also added
  dep on app-arch/unzip (because 1.1.27t is a .zip)

  09 Feb 2003; Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> :

  Added some warnings to avoid reports for already known issues.
  
  05 Feb 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  04 Feb 2003; Olivier Reisch <doctomoe@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.99.4.ebuild :
  
  Temporarily set to -ppc as we had to mask the fontconfig dependency, which
  tends to break fonts on ppc unless you recompile everything depending on it.
  Still pondering what to do about it :)

  Later, same day, a bit wiser: set back to ~ppc, tell ppl to recompile qt
  and kdelibs.

*xfree-4.2.99.4 (02 Feb 2003)

  24 Feb 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.99.4.ebuild files/4.2.99.4-patches/4.2.99.4-enable-nv-on-ppc.patch :

  Do not let portage strip binaries and libraries, as then it stips the
  DRI modules, which breaks things.  Change 4.2.99.3-r1 to compile fontconfig,
  but then we just remove all fontconfig related stuff.  This should fix things
  for Seemant and others.

  23 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> xfree-4.2.1-r2.ebuild,
                                                    xfree-4.2.99.3-r1.ebuild :

  Some form fixes.  Added some patches back in, although I should verify some
  of the left out ones.  Fix to not build Xft2.0 and fontconfig .. we rather
  depend on fontconfig and PDEPEND on x11-libs/xft.  Get it to depend on

  not present in xfree-4.2.1-r0.

  3 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  New version to address major problems we are having with 4.2.1.
  Ripped out Xft-1.2 (with fontconfig support), as it causes crashes
  with gcc3 at least.  Sync patches with Redhat/Mandrake again.  I
  will try to get behind the problem, but even with an unpatched
  Radeon driver, I cannot get DRI to work for the Radeon :(

  28 Oct 2002; J Robert Ray <jrray@jrray.org> xfree-4.2.1.ebuild :

  Allow unpriviliged user install, non-root fails to overwrite file

  Tahoma font, as a Windows license is needed (bug #9486).

  Fix typeo in pkg_postinst().
