  04 Jun 2004; Bryan Østergaard <kloeri@gentoo.org> elm-2.4_rc100.ebuild:
  Stable on alpha.

*elm-2.4_rc100 (29 May 2004)

  29 May 2004; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +elm-2.4_rc100.ebuild:
  Moved from net-mail/elm to mail-client/elm.

*elm-2.4_rc100 (23 Jan 2003)

  23 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> elm-2.4_rc100.ebuild,
  files/digest-elm-2.4_rc100 :
  This is ELM ME+ patch 100.
  New ebuild.  WARNING: sandbox is disabled for this build.  Elm-related
  files in /usrlib install directly to the filesystem as I have
  not been able to figure out how to get around the portion of install
  that generates the /usr/lib/elm.map.* directories via portage.
  Everything else installs cleanly through sandbox.  If anyone
  can come up with a sandboxed install mechanism, feel free to 
  do so.
  >=net-mail/mailbase-0.00-r5 is required as elm appears not to function
  when /var/mail (or more correctly /var/spool/mail) permissions are
  not 1777 until -r5.
