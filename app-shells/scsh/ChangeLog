*scsh-0.6.0 ( 25 Feb 2002 )

  25 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog scsh-0.6.0 files/digest-scsh-0.6.0:

  Scsh is a Unix shell embedded in Scheme. It provides full access to POSIX as
  well as extensions common to most Unix implementations. Scsh also features 
  many abstractions to ease system programming: process abstraction, 
  event-based interrupt handling, sophisticated I/O support and enables 
  concurrent system programming.
