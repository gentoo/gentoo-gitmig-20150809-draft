  18 Jun 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> eterm-0.9.1-r5.ebuild:

      #4051 eterm needs imlib other wise it will not compile, I'm not sure why
      there is --with-imlib option in ./configure, other then now in the cvs
      version that option does work, maybe they where added it in the future?
      Thanx to the guys on #e for helping me out on this :o).
