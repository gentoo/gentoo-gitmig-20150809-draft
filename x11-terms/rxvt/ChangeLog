*rxvt-2.7.10 (31 Mar 2003)

  03 Aug 2003; Mamoru KOMACHI <usata@gentoo.org> rxvt-2.7.10.ebuild:
  Changed master source site to sourceforge mirror.  Added cjk IUSE flag
  and JISX 0201 support patch.  This closes bug #23716.

  31 Mar 2003; Nicholas Wourms <dragon@gentoo.org> rxvt-2.7.10.ebuild,
  files/digest-rxvt-2.7.10, files/rxvt-2.7.10-azz4.diff:
  Bumped rxvt to 2.7.10 to fix the compiler error.  Updated ebuild with
  changes from 2.7.8's ebuild.  Rediffed the motif patch to apply correctly
  to the new rxvt.  Added new flags --enable-everything & --enable-256-color
  for a more robust with more color support rxvt.  No errors found during
  testing.  The ebuild is ~arch masked for now until it is tested further.
  This fixes bug #16742, as well.
