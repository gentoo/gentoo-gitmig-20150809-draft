  07 Apr 2004; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xterm-179.ebuild,
  xterm-184.ebuild:
  change to use_enable syntax, and also disable calling imake, so that this
  builds with xorg as well

*xterm-184 (17 Jan 2004)
  
  17 Jan 2004; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xterm-184.ebuild :

  Version bump.

  19 Oct 2003; Sven Blumenstein <bazik@gentoo.org> xterm-179.ebuild:
  Added sparc keyword.

  31 May 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xterm-179.ebuild:
  Added utempter as a DEPEND and also enabled 256-color. The latter should solve
  bug #13892 by Tom von Schwerdtner <tvon@etria.org>

*xterm-179 (30 May 2003)

  30 May 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xterm-179.ebuild:
  New package -- xterm's development happens outside of xfree, and then gets
  merged into xfree's source tree. This package follows xterm's development with
  the goal of removing xterm's compilation within the xfree ebuild.
  Ideally, this should work with utempter library in the near future.
