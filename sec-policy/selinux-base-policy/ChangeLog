*selinux-base-policy-20030729 (29 Jul 2003)

  29 Jul 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030729.ebuild:
  Make the ebuild use POLICYDIR. Important fix so portage can load policy so
  selinux-policy.eclass works. update_modules_t cleanup. Fix for an access when
  merging baselayout.

*selinux-base-policy-20030720 (20 Jul 2003)

  20 Jul 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030720.ebuild:
  Many fixes, including the syslog fix. File contexts have changed, so a relabel
  is needed. You may encounter problems relabeling /usr/portage, as its file
  context has changed, as files should not have the same type as a domain.
  Relabelling in permissive will fix this, or temporarily give portage_t a
  file_type attribute. Tightened the can_exec_any() macro. Moved staff.fc to
  users.fc, since all users with SELinux identities should have their home
  directories have the correct identity, not the generic identity.

  selinux-base-policy-20030604.ebuild:
  Mark stable

*selinux-base-policy-20030604 (04 Jun 2003)

  04 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030604.ebuild:
  Fix broken 20030603

  04 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030603.ebuild:
  Pulling 20030603, as there are problems, 20030604 later today

*selinux-base-policy-20030603 (03 Jun 2003)

  03 Jun 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030603.ebuild:
  Numerous various fixes. Added staff role. Removed ipsec, gpm and gpg policies
  as they are not appropriate for the base policy, and untested.

*selinux-base-policy-20030522 (22 May 2003)

  22 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030522.ebuild:
  The policy is in pretty good shape now. I've been able to run in enforcing mode
  with little problem. I've also been able to successfully merge and unmerge
  packages in enforcing mode, with few exceptions (why does mysql need to run ps
  during configure?).

*selinux-base-policy-20030514 (14 May 2003)

  14 May 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030514.ebuild:
  Many improvements in many areas. Of note, rlogind policies were removed. Klogd
  is being merged into syslogd. The portage policy is much more complete, but
  still needs work. Its suggested that all changes be merged in, policy
  reloaded, then relabel.

*selinux-base-policy-20030419 (19 Apr 2003)

  23 Apr 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>
  selinux-base-policy-20030419.ebuild:
  Marking stable for selinux-small stable usage

  19 Apr 2003; Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org> Manifest,
  selinux-base-policy-20030419.ebuild:
  Initial commit.  Base policies for SELinux, with Gentoo-specifics
