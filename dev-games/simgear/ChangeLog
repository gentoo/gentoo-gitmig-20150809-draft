  23 May 2007; Andrej Kacian <ticho@gentoo.org> simgear-0.3.10.ebuild:
  Stable on x86, bug #164239.

  21 Feb 2007; Piotr Jaroszyński <peper@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:

  06 Dec 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> simgear-0.3.9.ebuild,
  simgear-0.3.10.ebuild:
  Removing specific version of openal since the older CVS snapshot versions
  have been removed from the tree for some time now.

  17 Oct 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> -simgear-0.3.6.ebuild,
  -simgear-0.3.8.ebuild, simgear-0.3.9.ebuild:

  09 Aug 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> simgear-0.3.6.ebuild,
  simgear-0.3.8.ebuild, simgear-0.3.9.ebuild, simgear-0.3.10.ebuild:
  Removing dependency on CVS snapshots for openal, to force users onto the new
  0.0.8 version.

  09 May 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> simgear-0.3.6.ebuild,
  simgear-0.3.8.ebuild, simgear-0.3.9.ebuild, simgear-0.3.10.ebuild:
  First off, I would like to really, really apologise to anyone who looks at
  these dependencies. It's ugly. I know it. However, this is actually correct
  for the craziness in the tree with openal. At any rate, the idea is to fix
  this now, then remove all of the openal ebuilds except 0.0.8, then revisit
  this and clean up all of the extra cruft. Anyway, I apologise again. Enjoy.
