  +files/disabled-defaults.patch, +files/no-partial-match.patch,
  +files/quote-escape.patch, +files/too-many-flags.patch,
  +ufed-0.35-r2.ebuild:
  new revision featuring patches for bugs #59004, #68691, #68924 and #70776.
  Thanks to fn_x@hotmail.com for providing those. Also made the dialog
  dep more strict.Ideally this should be bumped straight to stable as some of
  these bugs prevent ufed from working at all, but the new dialog dep isn't yet
  stable on all archs. ufed-0.35 will probably be the last version of the perl
  version, it will likely be replaced by a python version soon.

*ufed-0.35-r1 (06 Oct 2004)

  06 Oct 2004; <genone@gentoo.org> +files/cascaded-profile-support.patch,
  +ufed-0.35-r1.ebuild +ChangeLog.old:
  adding a patch to support cascading profiles (bug #62261), thanks to lu_zero
  for providing that patch.
  Previous entries moved to ChangeLog.old as they aren't echangelog compatible.
