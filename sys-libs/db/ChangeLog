  25 May 2003; Paul de Vrieze <pauldv@gentoo.org> db-3.2.9-r5.ebuild,
  db-4.0.14.ebuild, db-4.1.24.ebuild:
  Fix a problem with the auto header linking script. It is not necessary toe
  locally, but in that case you need to do ln -s db4/db.h /usr/include/db.h

  25 May 2003; Paul de Vrieze <pauldv@gentoo.org> db-4.0.14.ebuild,

  24 May 2003; Paul de Vrieze <pauldv@gentoo.org> db-3.2.9-r5.ebuild,
  db-4.0.14.ebuild, db-4.1.24.ebuild:
  The db4 ebuilds have now been changed to live alongside the db3 ebuilds. Also
  the db-3.2.9-r5 ebuild is created to go along with the db-4 ebuilds. This
  ebuild is more gentle to the db4 ebuild, but upgrading this is not that
  necessary.
