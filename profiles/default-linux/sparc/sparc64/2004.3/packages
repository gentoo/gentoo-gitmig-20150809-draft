# sparc64 v9 32-bit userland packages

# Since we're running a sparc64 kernel w/ 32bit (v9) userland,
# we need gcc-sparc64 for kernels.
# Only use gcc-sparc64-3.3.x for now.  3.4.x users want the gcc34 profile
*<sys-devel/gcc-sparc64-3.4.0

# Sometimes necessary to trick programs into thinking we're really
# a sparc32 system.
