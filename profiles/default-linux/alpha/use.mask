# This file masks out USE flags that are simply NOT allowed in the default
# profile for any architecture.  This works, for example, if a non-default
# profile (such as the selinux profiles) have a USE flag associated with
# them.

# These are debatable, since technically an alpha could support this hardware

# alpha doesn't have java support other than compaq-j*, which isn't a

# I don't think that openafs really works on other architectures,
