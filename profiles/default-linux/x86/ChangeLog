  09 Aug 2006; Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> 2005.1/make.defaults,
  gcc2/make.defaults, 2006.0/make.defaults, no-nptl/make.defaults,
  xbox/make.defaults:
  Removed 'qt' USE flag per bug #137785

  02 Aug 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> 2006.1/deprecated,
  2006.1/desktop/deprecated:
  Fixed typo in default.

  26 Jul 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  2006.1/server/profile.bashrc:
  Fixing profile so it isn't nearly as annoying by making it only display once.

  -dev/2006.1/server/make.defaults, -dev/2006.1/server/parent, +dev/parent,
  -dev/profile.bashrc:
  This is a fairly extensive change, though not invasive to anyone.  I have
  moved the 2006.1 development profile out from the dev folder.  I have also
  added a profile.bashrc to warn any users using it, as well as deprecation
  files.  The parent for the dev profile has been set to ".." so it will be
  identical to the x86 profile at this time.  The profile.bashrc for the
  "server" subprofile informs users that it is not suitable for use, nor
  supported, and recommends server users to use the hardened profiles.

  26 Jul 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> -2005.0/deprecated,
  -2005.0/make.defaults, -2005.0/packages, -2005.0/parent:
  Removing 2005.0, as it has been deprecated for some time and the date for
  removal was June 30th.

  25 Jul 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  dev/2006.1/desktop/make.defaults:
  Removing the suggested USE flags from the desktop profile, as discussed on
  gentoo-dev mailing list. This brings us in sync with the USE flag set used
  to build the LiveCD.

  06 Jul 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> no-nptl/2.4/use.mask:
  I forgot to add input_devices_evdev to use.mask, so adding it now.

  06 Jul 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  no-nptl/2.4/package.mask:
  Added x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev to 2.4's package.mask since it requires
  2.6 structures.

  30 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  dev/2006.1/make.defaults:
  Removed comment about the keyboard/mouse stuff since spyderous moved it all
  to default-linux.

  27 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> use.mask:
  Removed mmx2 from unmask since it is not valid. This removes x86 from bug
  #138232.

  27 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> use.mask:
  Added ibm to use.mask since it is only used for IBM support on PPC64.

  27 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> 2005.0/make.defaults,
  dev/2006.1/desktop/make.defaults, 2005.1/make.defaults,
  gcc2/make.defaults, 2006.0/make.defaults, dev/2006.1/make.defaults,
  no-nptl/make.defaults, xbox/make.defaults:
  This is the initial version of the x86 profile ChangeLog.  The idea here is
  that we keep track of changes made to the profiles so we have a decent and
  easy-to-find history.  I've made a few changes to the profiles, which I'll
  document here.
  
  * Added qt3 and qt4 to default USE on the 2005.0, 2005.1, 2006.0, gcc2,
    no-nptl and xbox profiles
  * Replaced qt with qt3 and qt4 on the dev/2006.1/desktop profile
  * Added firefox to default USE on the dev/2006.1/desktop profile
  * Removed foomaticdb from the default USE on the dev/2006.1 profile
  * Added ppds to the default USE on the dev/2006.1 profile
