These profiles are development profiles and not meant for end users.  You
are welcome to use them to help development, but please realize that they
are subject to removal with only a 2 week deprecation period.  Here's the
email I sent to gentoo-amd64 which should explain their purpose:

Hi all,

lv's been busy with his new job, and he's given me his blessing to take
over multilib development in the toolchain.  As such, I'm going to be
creating a new amd64 profile series to work on multilib development with
the new multilib toolchain that I'm working on.  Some details can be
seen in the following bug report[1], and unfortunately the rest of the
details are in private emails between me, toolchain, and dev-portage.

Quick summary:
default-linux/amd64/multilib-dev/lib:
lib32 = 32bit
lib64 (lib -> lib64) = 64bit

default-linux/amd64/multilib-dev/lib64:
lib = 32bit
lib64 = 64bit

More detail:
default-linux/amd64/multilib-dev/lib is the replacement for
2004.3/lib64.  It should be safe to switch from the 2004.3/lib64 profile
to this one.  The only changes will be in how the multilib information
is passed to portage  (see the bug report or
default-linux/sparc/sparc64-multilib for the details about the new
method).

default-linux/amd64/multilib-dev/lib64 will almost certainly break any
current system, but the long term goal will be to have lib = 32bit and
lib64 = 64bit.  The problem is that many packages in portage are not yet
multilib aware.  This is a long-term target, but it's good to start
working now... especially since this support is neccessary for multilib
on sparc and mips.

Do NOT use these profiles unless you also use all patches in the bug
report as not everything is in the latest portage release.

I have added a check to make sure someone doesn't use this profile without
knowing these risks.  Please set a variable 'IWANTTOTRASHMYSYSTEM' in your
/etc/make.conf if you really want to test this profile.
