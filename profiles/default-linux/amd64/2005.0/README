HOWTO upgrade from 2004.3 and 2004.3/lib64 to 2005.0

 1) emerge -v '>=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51-r9'
 2) emerge unmerge app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-glibc
 3) rm /lib32 /usr/lib32 /usr/X11R6/lib32
 4) mkdir /lib32
 5) cp /emul/linux/x86/lib32/libsandbox.so /lib32
 6) emerge -v '>=sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.8-r1'
 7) rm /etc/make.profile
 8) ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/amd64/2005.0 /etc/make.profile
 9) cd /usr/tmp
10) wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~eradicator/grp/amd64/2005.0/glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1.tbz2
11) emerge -v glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1.tbz2
12) lynx -source http://dev.gentoo.org/~eradicator/fix_lib_symlinks.sh | sh
13) (OPTIONAL) emerge -uv glibc
14) emerge -upv system
15) emerge -uv system

Notes:
baselayout-1.11.8-r1 isn't in portage yet,  but you can use
http://dev.gentoo.org/~eradicator/baselayout-ml.patch to make what I'm using
for it.  When base-system releases 1.11.8-r1, it might have other fixes too,
so be sure to re-emerge, but this one should be fine for building stages.

The order is VERY important.

You MUST do every step even if you already have that version installed.
emerging glibc the second time is optional if you don't want to use my
options.

The script for step 12 isn't yet ready.  It's safe to skip for now.

The glibc binpkg that I have in my devspace is compiled with userlocales
to decrease the filesize and give infra a break.  If you need all the locales,
please use http://dev.gentoo.org/~eradicator/grp/amd64/2005.0/glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1.tbz2-alllocales (not there yet)

Also, I am rebuilding glibc as I accidently used gcc-3.3.5-r1 for the above
binpkg.  Where would the best place be to host this file?
