HOWTO upgrade from 2004.3 and 2004.3/lib64 to 2005.0

 1) emerge -v '>=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51-r9'
 2) emerge unmerge linux26-headers
 3) emerge -v linux-headers
 4) emerge unmerge app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-glibc
 5) rm /lib32 /usr/lib32 /usr/X11R6/lib32
 6) mkdir /lib32 /usr/lib32 /usr/X11R6/lib32
 7) cp /emul/linux/x86/lib32/libsandbox.so /lib32
 8) rm /etc/make.profile
 9) ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/amd64/2005.0 /etc/make.profile
10) cd /usr/tmp
11) wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~eradicator/grp/amd64/2005.0/glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1.tbz2
12) emerge -v glibc-2.3.4.20040808-r1.tbz2
13) (OPTIONAL) emerge -uv glibc
14) emerge -upv system
15) emerge -uv system

Notes:
The order is VERY important.

You MUST do every step even if you already have that version installed.

Emerging glibc the second time is optional if you don't want to use my
options.  It was made with gcc-3.4.3-r1:
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"
USE: -build -debug +emul-linux-x86 -erandom -hardened +multilib +nls +nptl +pic -userlocales

linux-headers is masked in the main package.mask still, so unmask it yourself.
linux26-headers-2.6.8.1-r3 will probably work, but I noticed it doesn't get
the headers in asm-i386/mach-*/, but my updated multilib.eclass method does
for linux-headers.

USE=multilib is now required.  If you don't have it set, you won't be able
to emerge anything, so please remove -multilib from your USE if you had it
set.
