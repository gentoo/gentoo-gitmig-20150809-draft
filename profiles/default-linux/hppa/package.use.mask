# DON'T TOUCH THIS FILE. INSTEAD, FILE A BUG AND ASSIGN IT TO hppa@gentoo.org

# Jeroen Roovers <jer@gentoo.org> (19 Nov 2007)
# build fails (bug #210880):
sys-devel/gcc libffi

# Jeroen Roovers <jer@gentoo.org> (19 Nov 2007)
# This pulls in dev-scheme/drscheme which needs the (yet unported) libffi to
# build or dev-lisp/clisp which has similar build issues.
# dev-scheme/chicken appears to be a horrible mess while compiling and not only
#  causes segfaults but issues illegal instructions as well.
dev-lang/swig mzscheme clisp chicken

# Samuli Suominen <drac@gentoo.org> (17 Nov 2007)
# Needs dev-util/valgrind
media-libs/gstreamer debug
media-libs/gst-plugins-base debug

# Jeroen Roovers <jer@gentoo.org> (12 Apr 2007)
# Mask until fixed.
