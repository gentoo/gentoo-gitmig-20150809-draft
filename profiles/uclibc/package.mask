# 27 Sep 2004; <carpaski@gentoo.org> (gentoo-core mailing list)
# Profiles have a package.mask for ARCHITECTURE related masking. There 
# must be an explicitly defined reason for using this file in any 
# particular way. It is NOT a general-use file. It is for specific 
# instances that involve incompatibilities between libs and specific 
# profiles.

# 29 Sep 2004; <solar@gentoo.org> 
# One package that we should never install via a R/DEPEND is glibc. But 
# from time to time an ebuild will creep into the tree which explicitly 
# depends on glibc and portage will build and install glibc for you.
# This would leave your system in an unstable state, so we prevent that 
# behavior here by the use of this masking.
#
# 10 Nov 2004; <solar@gentoo.org>
# binary only packages that were compiled for glibc but don't check for uclibc
# should probably be placed in here as well.
