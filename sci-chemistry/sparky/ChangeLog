  Prefer RESTRICT=mirror over nomirror, as portage code does.

  +files/fix-install.patch, +metadata.xml, +sparky-3.111.ebuild:
  A new graphical NMR assignment and integration program for proteins, nucleic
  acids, and other polymers. Very strange build system; takes lots of hacking
  and tweaking to get working. Doesn't work with python-2.4, only 2.3.
