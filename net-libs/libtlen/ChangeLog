*libtlen-20031114 (14 Nov 2003)

  14 Nov 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libtlen-20031114.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  library for an instant messaging (SMS) system in Poland. Ebuild submitted by:
  Marcin Jurczuk <spock@stars.eu.org> in bug #30370. However, I updated the
  snapshot date to 1114 (he subkmitted 1029), because the submitted version is
  no longer on the upstream mirrors. The 1114 snapshot has been copied to our
  mirrors. Please note that Marcin is the third party maintainer of this package
  through me.
