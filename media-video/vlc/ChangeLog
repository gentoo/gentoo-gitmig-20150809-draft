  Added support for libdvbpsi.

  29 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> :

  Added support for a52dec by default as it is marked as enabled by
  default in vlc's configure options and the a52dec author says we
  should give it a try.  :)  I have it set to depend on
  >=media-libs/a52dec-0.7.4 as previous versions were not thread
  safe.
