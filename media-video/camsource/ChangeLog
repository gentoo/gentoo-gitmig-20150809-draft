*camsource-0.7.0-r1 (09 Jun 2003)

  09 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> camsource-0.7.0-r1.ebuild:
  Initial import, I tagged it as stable because the only change
  from the 0.7.0 ebuild was that installed the necessary docs
  that came with it. I don't know why it wasn't done before,
  must have been an oversight.

*camsource-0.7.0 (09 Jun 2003)

  09 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> camsource-0.7.0.ebuild:
  Marked as stable for x86.

*camsource-0.7.0 (05 May 2003)

  05 May 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> camsource-0.7.0.ebuild:
  just the updated ebuild, nothing too crazy. I changed the description so it
  wasn't so fugly.

*camsource-0.5.1 (26 Nov 2002)

  26 Nov 2002; ZhEN <zhen@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.
