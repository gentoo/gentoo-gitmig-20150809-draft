  22 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild :

  Removed directfb flag for now, until next mplayer release.  Also, added
  --disable-runtime-cpudetection for increased performance.  First one thanks
  to naz in #gentoo, second one thanks to

  18 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  fixed a small typo I made in the matrox section

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild
  files/digest-mplayer-0.60-r6 :

  Removed -- the old source tarball will be mirrored on ibilio instead.

*mplayer-0.60-r6 (17 Apr 2002)

  17 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r6.ebuild
  files/digest-mplayer-0.60-r6 :

  This is an upgrade in a way, because it is now fetching the cvs snapshot
  from the site.  The actual 0.60 sources have been removed from the
  SRC_URI, and they are replaced with a weekly snapshot.  This is fine
  because it offers much better performance than the old "stable" version.

*mplayer-0.60-r5 (14 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r5.ebuild :

  Cleaned up some of the USE flag checking, and made it more consistent, so
  that there are no if then fi constructs for USE flags.

*mplayer-0.60-r5 (12 Apr 2002)

  14 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r5 :

  Remove the png USE flag, as the gui depends on libpng.  Take --enable-dvdread
  out of the main ./configure part, as its now done with the dvd use flag.
  Clean the mmx and X USE flag selection parts up.

*mplayer-0.60-r4 (12 Apr 2002)

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r4.ebuild :

  Added png USE flag and removed css USE flag for dvd flag instead. And, 
  compile against newest libpng

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  ogg and vorbis USE flags combined to have oggvorbis USE flag instead.

*mplayer-0.60-r3 (3 March 2002)

  3 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r3.ebuild :

  Add the DXR3 patch. Update the DEPEND to include libpng if gtk is in USE.

  Fix the 'fbcon' USE to actually enable fbdev support.

  17 Feb 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> mplayer-0.60-r2.ebuild :

  Make DVD support default.  Changed the USE flag for DVD decription from
  'decss' to 'css'.  Added 3DFX support with the '3dfx' use variable. Fixed
  a problem where if 'sse' or '3dnow' was in USE, but now MMX, sound would be
  distorted .. this should resolve bug #536.

*mplayer-0.60-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
