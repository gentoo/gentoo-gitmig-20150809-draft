# Gentoo MonetDB startup.mil script -- Fabian Groffen grobian@gentoo.org
#
# This script starts the SQL, XQuery and Mapi modules and activates a
# listening socket for all of them on their default port.  This results
# in three ports of your system being occupied.  By default the ports
# are as follows:
# SQL server:    45123
# XQuery server: 45789
# Mapi server:   50000

# should connections be bound to localhost or 0.0.0.0?  Set to true here
# to allow foreign connections.  Defaults to false (only local).
var allow_foreign_connections := false;

#
# If were only looking for whatever you could change, you can stop
# reading at this point and save your changes.  Don't change anything
# below if you don't know what you're doing.
