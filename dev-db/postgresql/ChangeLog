*postgresql-7.1.3-r4 (5 Feb 2002)

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> postgresql-7.1.3-r4.ebuild :
  Changed data dirs to use a fixed path instead of determining it from the
  package name. Also added a binary compatibility slot. Changed data dir to
  /var/lib/postgresql/data to follow what has been done by the mysql ebuild.

  5 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> files/7.1.3/postgresql :
  Fixed wrong data dir in init script.

*postgresql-7.1.3-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
