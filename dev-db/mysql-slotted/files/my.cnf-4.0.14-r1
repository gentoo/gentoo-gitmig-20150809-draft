# This file can be simultaneously placed in three places:
# 1. /etc/mysql/my.cnf to set global options.
# 2. /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf to set server-specific options.
# 3. ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run the program with --help to get a list of them.
#
# The following values assume you have at least 32M RAM!

# If you really need logging, use rather binary logging. Especially when doing
# replication. Read
# file:/usr/share/doc/mysql-*/manual.html.gz#Replication
# You can use PURGE MASTER LOGS TO '$hostname-bin.010' to get rid of old logs
# from $hostname-bin.01 up to $hostname-bin.09 while the slave server is
# running.
# Before doing that, check which logfile slave curently uses by running
# mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS
# To list logfiles on master do:
# mysql> SHOW MASTER LOGS
# Then use PURGE for those not needed anymore only! Never remove the files
# manually!
#
# Also consult RESET MASTER and RESET SLAVE commands before doing any changes
# mysql> RESET MASTER - Deletes all binary logs listed in the index
#                       file, resetting the binlog index file to be empty.
# mysql> RESET SLAVE - Makes the slave forget its replication position in
#                      the master logs.
# mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0  - this turns off logging (execute on MASTER only)
# mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1  - this turns on logging (execute on MASTER only)
