To complete installation, you must

1. Update MySQL's grant tables and the pmadb database:
     mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/webapps/phpmyadmin/VERSION/sqlscripts/mysql/VERSION_create.sql

If you are upgrading from an earlier version and are using phpMyAdmin's
features for master/foreign tables be sure to read
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/Documentation.html#col_com
You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.

Finally, point your browser to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}
