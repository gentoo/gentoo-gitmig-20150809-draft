*linux-sources-2.4.17-r5 (12 Mar 2002)
*linux-sources-2.4.18 (12 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Reworked internals of
  2.4.17-r5 and 2.4.18 ebuilds but did not bump version since the actual kernel
  sources are the same.  A lot of streamlining.  In addition, we now use the
  existing .config of the currently-active (pointed to by /usr/src/linux)
  kernel if available.  Many things were moved to pkg_postinst() as they fit
  better there.  We now do a "make dep" after the kernel sources are installed.
  This closes bug #1045, which will cause any kernel module-related ebuild
  merges to fail if linux-sources has been updated without the user doing a
  manual "make dep".

*linux-sources-2.2.x (28 Feb 2002)

  28 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>:
  New 2.2 sources; read ebuilds for comments.  Note: Masked until the
  necessary sys-apps/baselayout changes become available.  

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r5 (14 Feb 2002)

  14 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>:
  acpi-20020214-2.4.17.diff.gz added back since they closed bug #689 for us;
  ide-2.4.17.02072002.patch has been removed due to bug #690 and will be added
  back when this bug is closed (The existence of this bug has been confirmed
  with the patch author)

*linux-sources-2.4.17-r4 (13 Feb 2002)

  13 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: XFS was updated from "26
  Jan 2002" to "13 Feb 2002"; IDE patch updated from "01192002" to "02072002";
  RML preempt patch was updated from 2.4.17-1 to 2.4.17-3; irqrate-a1 was
  removed (closing bug #396 and possibly others); acpi-20020208-2.4.17 was
  added but then removed.  It conflicts with stock aic7xxx SCSI driver and a
  bunch of other stuff; bug report sent "upstream" to their bug tracker at
  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/acpi and also recorded in our bug tracker
  at http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689.  We will add this patch back
  once these various issues have been resolved.
