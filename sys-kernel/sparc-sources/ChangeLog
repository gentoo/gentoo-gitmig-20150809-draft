  Added arch keywords (sparc sparc64 -ppc -x86)

  12 May 2002; M.Thibaut <murphy@gentoo.org> :
  This is the 2.2.20 version of the Linux kernel with the devfs patch
  added. You should be able to to use the linux-vanilla sources instead,
  but you can use this kernel if you want Linux 2.2.x.

  This is only intended towards sparc 32 bit platforms (sun4[cdm]) but
  should be usable by all platforms.
