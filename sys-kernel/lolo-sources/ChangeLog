*lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre1 (19 Sep 2002)

  19 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.10_pre1.ebuild:

  Fix kernel version to not confuse mozilla any more, this kernel's
  designation is officially linux-2.4.19-r10-lolo_pre1, and no I don't
  care if you hate my naming scheme... it clearly attaches my 
  pre-release kernels to their appropriate gentoo-sources releases, etc.

  Updated all patches with known updates to their latest
  (JFS, preempt, rmap, nfs, nfs-over-tcp)

  Add xattr and acl patches and include the JFS patches for them.

  Add supermount patches.

  Incorportate the small fixes done to gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9 into
  the main patchball.

  Coming before gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r10:
  - updated grsecurity, pending upstream release
  - updated defconfig patch with better defaults for i386
  - updated and improved patches.txt documentation
  - backports for AMD74xx, radeonfb, and HPT366 driverd from -ac
    done by Michael Cohen <mjc@gentoo.org>
  - incorporate ACPI from acpi.sourceforge.net
  - Possibly other, depending on stability, timing, and how much I get
    harrassed about things :)
  - Fix compilation issues with sim710 and i810dma (I hope)

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc2 (02 Sep 2002)

  02 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc2.ebuild:

  Removed lock-break, contains known races against 2.4.19.

  Fix grsecurity/Config.in for badness.

  Add some things from iptables-patch-o-matic thanks to Azarah.

  Put back missing IDE Taskfile IO option in config.

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc1 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_rc1.ebuild:

  Thanks to Doug Goldstein <cardoe@gentoo.org> for all his testing to pin down
  a problem in the lvcool patch and then fixing it.  (even though the patch
  didn't end up in this kernel)

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre2 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre2.ebuild:

  Added default config patch, fixed alsa-driver compilation against this kernel, 
  fixed version setting issues with the ebuild (with any luck).

*lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre1 (01 Sep 2002)

  01 Sep 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> lolo-sources-2.4.19.9_pre1.ebuild:
