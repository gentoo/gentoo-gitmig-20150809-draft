  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*ppc-sources-2.4.20-r1 (10 Oct 2002)

  10 Oct 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> ppc-sources-2.4.20-r1 :

  New PPC benh kernel + XFS.  Please remember that turning on XFS is optional.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r6 (12 Jun 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org>
  Added arch keywords (ppc -x86 -sparc -sparc64)

  12 Jun 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  We are back to a standard kernel + XFS.  This will be the ppc-sources used
  for the gentoo-ppc-1.2 bootcd.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r5 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  Firewire still works, but otherwise this kernel is more like -r3.
  The rmap vm doesn't seem to work too well on ppc after additional testing.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r4 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Kain <kain@kain.org> all :

  Firewire works again.  This kernel implements the O(1) scheduler, XFS,
  the rmap VM, and the HZ=1000 timer.

*ppc-sources-2.4.19-r3 <kain@kain.org> :

  Second official ppc kernel release:

  More drivers in the defconfig for the cdrom image have been integrated;
  We also have the drm-kernel from the ati.2 drivers at gatos.sf.net integrated
  in.  These work better on the TiBook rev2 (I don't know about rev3).

  Fixes also in the ebuild

*ppc-sources-2.4.19 <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> :

  First official ppc kernel release
