IUSE="build crypt"

# OKV=original kernel version, KV=patched kernel version.  They can be the same.

# Kernel ebuilds using the kernel.eclass can remove any patch that you
# do not want to apply by simply setting the KERNEL_EXCLUDE shell
# variable to the string you want to exclude (for instance
# KERNEL_EXCLUDE="evms" would not patch any patches whose names match
# *evms*).  Kernels are only tested in the default configuration, but
# this may be useful if you know that a particular patch is causing a
# conflict with a patch you personally want to apply, or some other
# similar situation.

# This kernel also has support for the local USE flag acpi4linux which
# activates the latest code from acpi.sourceforge.net instead of the
# very out of date vanilla version
