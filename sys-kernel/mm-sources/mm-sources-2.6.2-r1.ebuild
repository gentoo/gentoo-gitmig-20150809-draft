K_EXTRAEINFO="If there are issues with this kernel, search http://bugs.gentoo.org/ for an
existing bug. Only create a new bug if you have not found one that matches
your issue. It is best to do an advanced search as the initial search has a
very low yield. Please assign your bugs to x86-kernel@gentoo.org.
Please read the ChangeLog and associated docs for more information."

K_EXTRAEWARN="NOTE: processor selection has changed. You'll need to make sure you
select the proper cpu type during make oldconfig"
