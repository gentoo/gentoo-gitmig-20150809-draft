	Initial ChangeLog.  Sources currently include:

	
	2.4.19-pre10 		- latest prepatch for Linux 2.4
	2.4.19-pre10-ac2 	- Alan Cox's patchset for the latest prepatch
	rmap13b  		- Rik van Riel's latest update to the 
				  Reverse Mappng VM, the previous version 
				  of which is included in Alan Cox's patchset
	TIOGCDEV		- ioctl to return the console mapping
	Preemptible Kernel
		for 2.4.18	- Robert M. Love's preemptible kernel for 2.4,
				  allows the kernel to be interrupted during
				  syscalls.  Drastically lowers latency and
				  allows for higher throughput in some cases,
				  especially multiprocessor systems.
	Lock-Break for Preempt	- Rodbert M. Love's preemptible kernel addon.
				  Lock-Break delves far into the kernel to
				  locks not preemptible by traditional 
				  preempt.
	Autofs4			- One-liner that gets rid of autofs4_init_inf.
	isrdonly		- little update to IS_RDONLY()
	new stat		- New VFS stat system
	llseek			- new llseek specifically for vfs
	mount			- do_kern_mount - easy way to unmount a device
				  from kernelspace
	ftpfs			- allows the user to mount an FTP read-only
				  like this:
				   mount -t ftpfs ohdarn.net/incoming /ohdarn
	cdda-dma		- enables direct memory access while
				  extracting digital audio
	fast-pte		- fixup for X86 highmem greater 
				  than 4G, faster page table allocations
				  and frees
	bootcpu			- prevents overwriting corrected x86
				  capability information on multiprocessor
				  machines
	sis-740-961		- support for the SiS 740 chipset
	limits			- limit increases
	nand-softirq		- missing include in nand.c
	mount-hashtable		- hash table cleanups, uses less space
	megaraid		- miscellaneous fix =)
	pipe-init		- inode->i_blocks wasn't getting initialized
				  in pipe.c
	realmode-poweroff	- enable real mode BIOS call to 
				  power off machine by default
	vfat-truncate		- fix file too large on vfat, returns -EPERM
				  instead of -ENOSPC
	smbfs-fix		- smbfs fix that allows directories with the 
				  same name as the volume label to show 
				  correctly from windows 9x machines
	jfs-txlocks		- increase number of txLocks in jfs
	ide-noop-2		- gets rid of the NOOP elevator
	tty_io			- off-by-one error in tty_io.c
	secfix			- "fixes" a security hole in the kernel
	netdev-random-
		[core,drivers]	- allows network devices to contribute to
				  /dev/random.  Useful for machines that have
				  no disks, keyboards, video, etc.
	[b,i,d]cache-hash	- alternative hashing functions that show
				  performance/size savings over traditional
				  methods
	dpath			- dpath didn't return -ENAMETOOLONG
	fast-exit		- shouldn't print kill idle task and init
	htb2			- driver for htb2
	ipvs			- IP Virtual Server support.  Allows one 
				  physical machine to appear as many virtual
				  machines based on IP address.
	gcc31-compile-opts	- compilation options changed for gcc 3.1,
				  should increase performance and decrease
				  code size marginally.
	vfat-symlink		- treats .lnk files as symlinks on fat32
	ms-permission		- check write permission on mount
	evms-[common,linux-2.4] - Enterprise Volume Management Support
				  based on LVM, but it whips LVM like cream.
				  see http://evms.sf.net
	via-fixups,lvcool	- fixes a couple VIA bugs and allows 
				  [ath,dur]ons to run a few degrees cooler on
				  VIA mainboards.
	setid-core		- allows process that are set[u,g]id to
				  dump core
	quotareturn		- quota messages were missing \r
	oomavoidance		- tries to keep from dealing as if kernel is
				  out of memory when in fact it is not
	keyboardsilence		- gets rid of 
				  "AT or PS/2 Keyboard not present? ($FOO)",
				  useful on USB systems
	xfs-*			- XFS 1.1 support.  XFS is a fast, journalled
				  filesystem developed by Silicon Graphics,
				  Inc.

				  patches function correctly.
