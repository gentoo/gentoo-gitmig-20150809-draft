  14 Jun 2002; Doug Goldstein (Cardoe) <dougg@ufl.edu> libflash-0.4.10-r1.ebuild :
  
  Fixed some redundant stuff in the ebuild and the major thing is I included a patch
  that makes it actually compile with gcc3.1. The patch has no effect on gcc2.95 and 
  has been confirmed to compile on both platforms.
