  (Nicholas)

  7 Aug 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> : 
  Changed package to use system libpng. PHP doesn't like being
  linked to two separate places.
  
  Edward Roper states, "php.net indicates it's a conflict of 
  pdflib's png support and libpng... if pdflib is compiled to use 
  system libpng and not internal libpng it will supposedly work..."

  Which he then verified.

  3 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : New revision -- we dodir
  /usr/bin (required for make install), closing bug 1498.  Also, now some
  installation steps requiring java are conditional on the java USE variable
  being set.
