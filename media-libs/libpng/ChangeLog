*libpng-1.2.2 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>

  Quick version update (new version fixes many bugs; whatever).  Kaali in 
  #gentoo is to be thanked for finding the two bogus symlinks that the make
  install process installs.  Those are fixed with the two dosym operations
  in src_install()

*libpng-1.0.12-r1 and libpng-1.2.1-r1 (13 April 2002)

  13 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  In order to prevent users from having to almost completely rebuild their 
  system after they upgraded to 1.2.1, i'm adding SLOT's to 1.0.x and 
  1.2.x, so they can happily live together :o)

*libpng-1.0.12 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
