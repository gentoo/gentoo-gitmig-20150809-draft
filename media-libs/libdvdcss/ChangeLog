  Added ppc to keywords

  11 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Update to latest version.

*libdvdcss-1.2.1 (24 Jun 2002)

  24 Jun 2002; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> :

  Bumped to new version, because it was there and it fixes a playing problem
  for me. Notice that it seems to have changed a lot since 1.1.1, so you might
  want to try 1.1.1 to see if that works better for you.

*libdvdcss-1.2.0 (26 May 2002)

  26 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Update to latest version.

*libdvdcss-1.1.1-r2 (23 May 2002)

  23 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Ok, this should resolve bug #2908.

*libdvdcss-1.1.1-r1 (22 May 2002)

  22 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Try to resolve invalid symlink issue (bug #2908), and
  also an issue on certain archs where it could not
  decrypt dvds.

*libdvdcss-1.1.1 (6 Apr 2002)

*libdvdcss-0.0.3.3 (1 Feb 2002)
