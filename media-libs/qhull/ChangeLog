*qhull-3.1 ( 10 Feb 2002 )

  10 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> ChangeLog files/digest-qhull-3.1 qhull-3.1.ebuild:

  Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace 
  intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay 
  triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 
  4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm for 
  computing the convex hull. Qhull handles roundoff errors from floating 
  point arithmetic. It computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to
  the convex hull.

  Qhull does not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, triangulation of
  non-convex surfaces, mesh generation of non-convex objects, or medium-sized 
  inputs in 9-D and higher.
