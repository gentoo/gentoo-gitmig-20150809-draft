  30 Sep 2004; Michael Sterrett <mr_bones_@gentoo.org>
  +sdl-sound-1.0.1-r1.ebuild:
  Removed hard-coded smpeg support and have sdl-sound use the internal
  decoder for mp3 instead.  smpeg is far too buggy to be used at this time.
  As a result the unpack routine was cleaned up since the buggy test that
  failed with gcc33 wasn't used anymore.  General cleaning of the ebuild
  as well.
