  quicktime4linux-1.5.5.ebuild files/digest-quicktime4linux-1.5.5 :

  Version bump thanks to gentoo-bugs@devrieze.net (Paul de Vrieze) in bug
  # 1601.  We need an alternative to this library, since the loss of 
  its configure step means no cross-compilation is possible.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
