  15 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libmpeg3-1.5-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-libmpeg3-1.5-r1 files/libmpeg3-gentoo-patch-part1
  files/libmpeg3-gentoo-patch-part2 :

  It seems that the libmpeg3 folks did not design libmpeg3 well for installing
  the header files.  This is unfortunate because a few applications like
  transcode and mplayer need those headers in order to build libmpeg3 support.
  Their src.rpm's however, take care of this problem through patching.  So,
  to this end, I have patched the Makefile in patch-part1 to actually
  install the header files.  And I have patched the header files themselves
  in patch-part2 so that they include one another properly with 
  #include <blah> instead of #include "../blah"  This works well, so far.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
