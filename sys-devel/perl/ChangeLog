* perl-5.8.0-r6 (17 Dec 2002)

  17 Dec 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> perl-5.8.0-r6.ebuild :
  -arch this bad boy, it reb0rk what I unb0rk last night, stick with -r5
  will probably skip -r6 for the moment and go to -r7 with some more 
  fixage when we know what to refix more :)

  17 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.8.0-r6.ebuild:

  Further fixes to path writing. If the user asks for threading, the
  dirs are $[arch]-linux-thread-multi. If not, the paths are
  $[arch]-linux - this is correct behaviour!! Installation with
  threading is *not* supported by all apps that dep perl.

* perl-5.8.0-r5 (17 Dec 2002)

  17 Dec 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> perl-5.8.0-r5.ebuild:

  Fix threading use flag thingus, it doesn't put things in ${D}/${D} later 
  now.  Fix messages to only display if needed.  You will need to remerge
  all your perl modules after you install this with threads.

* perl-5.8.0-r4 (15 Dec 2002)

  15 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.8.0-r4.ebuild:

  Made threading an internal use flag. This is to be used with caution.
  Added eerror messages to warn users of potential probs.

  13 Dec 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> perl-5.6.1-r9.ebuild :

  Fix screwup in DEPEND, RDEPEND and PDEPEND.

  12 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.6.1-r9.ebuild:

  PDEPEND is in portage now, can unmask this. This -r installs the
  makemaker fix after installing perl - finally fixed. Thanks carpaski!

  11 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.8.0-r3.ebuild:

  Busy day =:) Added LC_ALL=C into 5.8 (a fix made for 5.6.1, but lost)

  11 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.8.0-r3.ebuild:

  Changed emake back to make. bcowan pointed out that the parallel
  make fails for him, which is legit
  
  11 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> 
  perl-5.6.1-r9.ebuild:

  Pulled until PDEPEND is in. This worked only for those not behind
  firewalls, and unfortunately perl needs to work across the board.

*perl-5.6.1-r9 (10 Dec 2002)

  10 Dec 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-5.6.1-r9.ebuild:

  Major fixes, including the inclusion of the ExtUtils-MakeMaker fix
  directly into perl's ebuild (thanks seemant!).
  
* Autoupdate keywords (12-6-02)
  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
  26 Nov 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>:

  Corrected deps in perl-5.6.1-r8 per bugs 4116 and 9314

*perl-5.6.1-r8 (13 Oct 2002)

  22 Nov 2002; <mcummings@gentoo.org>

  Added einfo note (finally) to instruct users to install MakeMaker
  patch. Also added catch for cases where -gdbm and -berkdb are in 
  the use flags - perl requires at least one of them to be available

  Second incantation of -r8. This time, it is for LC_ALL=C being added to 
  the ebuild itself. Perl won't compile correctly otherwise and handles
  internationaliztion post install.

  13 Oct 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> perl-5.6.1-r8.ebuild
  files/digest-perl-5.6.1-r8 :

  The fixes from -r7 didn't seem to make it into portage. So this version
  has those, plus the updated MakeMaker.  should close bug #8998 by
  rac@intrigue.com (Robert Coie)

*perl-5.6.1-r7 (02 Oct 2002)

  02 Oct 2002; mcummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> : Thanks entirely to seemant, 
  this release incorporates the MakeMaker fix directly into perl ebuild process.
  
*perl-5.8.0-r3 (13 Sep 2002)

*perl-5.8.0-r2 (16 Aug 2002)

  16 Aug 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> : added
  fix for gcc compile flags that corrects problems with apps 
  compiling against perl. 

*perl-5.8.0-r1 (10 Aug 2002)

  05 Aug 2002; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> : added 
  threading, fixed hard coded architecture prefix, cleaned up
  ebuild

*perl-5.6.1-r3 (5 May 2002)

  5 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> perl-5.6.1-r4.ebuild
  files/digest-perl-5.6.1-r4 :

  Added an eclass called perl-post.eclass, which this ebuild now inherits,
  so that the .pod file in ${libarchdir} gets updated cleanly with
  emerging and unmerging.

*perl-5.6.1-r3 (21 Mar 2002)

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> perl-5.6.1-r3.ebuild :

  HTML documentation no longer gets gzipped, but a revision upgrade wasn't
  absolutely necessary, I don't think.  Thanks to stefan@mdy.univie.ac.at
  for pointing it out.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
