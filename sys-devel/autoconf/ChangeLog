  23 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ac-wrapper.pl :

  Firstly i should mention that the perl wrapper 'ac-wrapper.pl', is
  based on great work by Guillaume Cottenceau (gc@mandrakesoft.com).
  This updates it to correctly detect if automake-1.6 was used.

autoconf-2.53a (22 May 2002)

  22 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> autoconf-2.53a.ebuild :

  Update in hope of fixing the gcc3 build problem (somewhere with
  m4 version detection, bug #2929.  I am not sure, as I could not
  get feedback if working or not.

autoconf-2.53-r1 (19 May 2002)

  19 May 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> autoconf-2.53-r1.ebuild :

  Fix it to use "-$PV" as suffix, and not "-2.5x".

  22 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> ac-wrapper.pl :

  Update so that it can work with AC_PREREQ([2.13]) as well as AC_PREREQ(2.13).

autoconf-2.52d-r1 (21 March 2002)

  7 April 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Change the names of the 2.5x binaries to foo-${PV}, since they do support
  limited parallel versions, and foo-2.5x breaks recursion if they call
  themselfs.  Fixed doc paths.

*autoconf-2.53 (21 March 2002)

  21 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Add dual ebuild which contain 2.13 and 2.53, and autodetect the
  correct version to use.

*autoconf-2.13-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
