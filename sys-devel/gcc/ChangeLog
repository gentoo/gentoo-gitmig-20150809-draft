*gcc-3.1.1-r1 (30 Jul 2002)

  30 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1.1-r1 :

  Gcc-3.1.1 final.  Also fixed it to be able to disable java.
  Major cleanups from 3.1.1.

*gcc-3.2_pre (28 Jul 2002)

  30 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.2_pre :

  Some cleanups.  Use the "java" USE flag to enable/disable java
  as it add a bit to compile time.

  28 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.2_pre :

  Add CVS version of gcc-3.2.

*gcc-3.1.1 (07 Jul 2002)

  7 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1.1 :

  Add snapshot for gcc-3.1.1.  This fixes the internal compiler
  errors with "-march=pentium4" for me at least (had with gcc-3.1).

*gcc-3.1-r8 (03 Jul 2002)

  6 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r8 :

  Update the fix for bug #4411, as the old caused ncurses, among things
  not to link properly if an older version was installed.  The sed
  rule is now:

  sed -e "s:%{L\*} %(link_libgcc):%{L\*} -L/lib %(link_libgcc):" specs


  3 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r8 :

  Move all the libs to the version specific directory.  Add a fix for
  bug #4411, which should be considered *very* experimental.

  3 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Add the /usr/bin/$CHOST-g++ symlink, as it is needed now for
  some weird reason.

*gcc-2.95.3-r7 (29 Jun 2002)

  29 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Remove texinfo as we have an ebuild again. 

  This new patch for the atexit problem occured with glibc-2.2.3 should
  work with glibc-2.2.4.  This closes bug #3987 and #4004.

    http://archive.linuxfromscratch.org/mail-archives/lfs-dev/2001/08/0589.html
  
  Something to note, is that this patch makes gcc crash if its given
  the "-mno-ieee-fp" flag ... libvorbis is an good example of this.
  This however is on of those which one we want fixed most cases :/
  
  Also fix bug #3527, which was caused by a stray symlink on downgrading from
  gcc-3.x.

*gcc-3.1-r7 (29 June 2002)

  29 June 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r6.ebuild :

  Make sure that static linking against gcc libraries works with a little
  sed magic :).

  25 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> texinfo providing ebuilds :
  Add ibiblio to SRC_URI for all texinfo providing ebuilds (2.95.3 and 3.0.4);
  resolve bug #1777.

*gcc-3.1-r6 (10 June 2002)

  11 June 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r6.ebuild :

  Update version checking.

  10 June 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> Changelog:
 
  Remove curses.h and ncurses.h from the installation, so it doesn't 
  conflict with our ncurses package.


*gcc-3.1-r5 (29 May 2002)

  29 May 2002; Matthew Kennedy <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r5.ebuild,
  ChangeLog, files/digest-gcc-3.1-r5 :

  Fixes how we check for already install gcc's.

*gcc-3.1-r4 (25 May 2002)

  25 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r4.ebuild :

  Fix some more files that got installed in the wrong location.  From
  gcc-3.1, locales is installed in $datadir, so we should not set that
  to a custom dir, and since libgcj.jar now have the version appended,
  it should not be a problem with multiple version installs anymore.

*gcc-3.1-r3 (25 May 2002)

  25 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r3.ebuild :

  Added some Redhat/Suse/Mandrake patches.

*gcc-3.1-r2 (24 May 2002)

  24 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r2.ebuild :

  Use the correct library versions in src_install().

*gcc-3.1-r1 (20 May 2002) 
  20 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1-r1.ebuild :
  removed all texinfo references in gcc 3.1 ebuild. 
  
*gcc-3.1 (17 May 2002)

  17 May 2002; Preston Elder <prez@gentoo.org> gcc-3.1 :

  Added the 3.1 ebuild.

*gcc-3.0.4-r6 (2 May 2002)

  3 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r6 :

  Fix some typo's thanks to Jared H. Hudson.

*gcc-3.0.4-r5 (2 May 2002)

  2 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r5 :

  Only move .la files for parallel builds, else some packages (KDE *grin*)
  fails to build.

*gcc-2.95.3-r6 (30 Apr 2002)

  30 Apr 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: removed libiberty.a as
  binutils installs it.  This closes bug #2266.

*gcc-3.0.4-r4 (25 Apr 2002)

  25 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r4 :

  Only apply the gcc3-program-transform.patch patch if building 
  a multiple install of gcc.

  17 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> gcc-3.0.4-r3 :

  Move .la files to gcc internal dir to fix gcc2+libtool problems
  of trying to link /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.

*gcc-3.0.4-r3 (16 Apr 2002)

  16 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Moved the manpages to version spesific ones.  More cleanups.
  Moved libgcj.jar to /usr/lib/gcc-$PV.

*gcc-3.0.4-r2 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  This build enables us to have multiple versions of gcc
  installed.

*gcc-3.0.4 (1 Mar 2002)

  1 Mar 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Added 3.0.4.  It looks like using the --disable-checks
  command fixes most of the sandbox violations that we had
  with 3.0.3 (or 3.0.4 no longer tries to update system
  headers; I'm not sure which).
  
*gcc-2.95.3-r5 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
