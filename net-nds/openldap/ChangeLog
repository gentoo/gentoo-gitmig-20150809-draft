  09 Jul 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27-r4,
  files/2.0/slapd, files/2.0/slapd.conf:
  Updated example to include ldapi.  Added eval to the slapd init.d
  so the %2f is parsed properly.  Changed the location of the slapd.args
  in the default config and installed config.  Thanks to robbat2 for
  working this solution out.  Marking stable for x86.

  08 Jul 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27-r4:
  Fixed the conf.d slapd filename and added some code to pkg_postinst
  so correct permissions are passed to directories/files affected by the 
  upgrade from running as root to running as user/group ldap.

*openldap-2.0.27 (25 Nov 2002)

  21 Dec 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27.ebuild :
  db4 is not required for this version.  Also fixed readline
  dependancy as to not squash the 1.0 profile.

  27 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.27.ebuild,
  files/digest-openldap-2.0.27 :
  Updated stable series of openldap.

  25 Nov 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.1.8.ebuilod,
  files/digest-openldap-2.1.8 :
  New ebuild of openldap.  Lots of configure updates.  Needs lots of
  testing.  The ebuild depends on db4 so all arches are marked - until
  db4 is marked unstable for testing.

*openldap-2.0.25-r3 (21 Sept 2002)

  11 Oct 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r3.ebuild :
  Removed sasl support as saslv2 support is not complete in this and
  causes a circular dependancy with cyrus-sasl.  cyrus-sasl still has
  ldap support built in.

  21 Sept 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r3.ebuild
  Replaced entire make install section w/ "make DESTDIR=${D} install".
  The previous version was putting ${D} in the /etc/openldap files, and
  the simple fix seems to have solved the problem.   I also checked, and
  sysconfdir seems to be working correctly, so I don't think I've broken
  Seemant's fix.

*openldap-2.0.25-r2 (15 Aug 2002)

  16 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> openldap-2.0.25-r2.ebuild

  directory instead of /etc/openldap/openldap.  Thanks to:
  gdjohn@egregious.org.uk (Gareth John) in bug #7986

  07 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org>
  openldap-2.0.25-r2.ebuild :
  Fixed the use flags so that they are not prefixed with "ldap-"  as
  discovered by jap1@ionet.net (Jacob Perkins) and kevin@aptbasilicata.it
  (j2ee) in bug #7597

  15 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  openldap-2.0.25-r2.ebuild, files/digest-openldap-2.0.25-r2 :

  openldap-2.0.25-r1, files/slapd.rc6, files/digest-openldap-2.0.25-r1 :
  Updated ebuild for proper USE flag to configure option generation.  Fixed
  a typo in slapd.rc6.  Bumping to -r1 due to the many changes in the ebuild
  since the first 2.0.25 release.

*openldap-2.0.25 (17 Jul 2002)

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> files/slapd.rc6 :

  error messages when shutting doesn slapd.

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  re-modified ebuild so localstatedir=/var/state/openldap to match with the
  default slapd config file.  /var/state/openldap/openldap-ldbm and
  /var/state/openldap/openldap-slurp are also created correctly.
  Bug #5557 re-visited.

  26 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  modified ebuild to create a /var/state/openldap to conicide with default
  configuration of where databases are stored.  Closes bug #5557.
