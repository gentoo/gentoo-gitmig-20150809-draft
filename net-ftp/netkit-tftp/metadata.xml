  Tftp is the user interface to the Internet TFTP (Trivial File Transfer
  Protocol), which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote machine.
  The remote host may be specified on the command line, in which case tftp uses
  host as the default host for future transfers. Tftpd is a server which
  supports the Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol (RFC 783). The TFTP
  server operates at the port indicated in the `tftp' service description; see
  services(5). The server is normally started by inetd(8).
