  files/digest-xdaf-0.01.10:

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way.

  The release version is actually called xdaf-A.01.10, but portage doesn't
  like an ebuild with that name. Slight workaround with 0.01.10 and munging
  inside the ebuild, but it works.
