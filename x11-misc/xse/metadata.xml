    xse provides a way to send arbitrary XEvents to a window, sort of the
    opposite of xev(1).

	xse is basically a command line wrapper around the Xlib XSendEvent()
	function, allowing you to send any kind of event to X11 applications,
	such as input events, motion or configure notification, or any other.
	
	This can be useful for scripting interaction, debugging applications
	and experimenting with events while developing X11 applications.
