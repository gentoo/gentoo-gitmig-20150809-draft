  26 Oct 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> genmenu-0.9.0.ebuild, files/{digest-genmenu-0.9.0,genmenu-0.9.0.patch} :

  new package

  menu generator for few wm's. From the freshmeat page:
  Genmenu generates menus for some common window managers based on which program binaries genmenu finds 
  installed on a system (a list of programs to search for are contained within the script). Users can 
  to a limited degree further customize their menu via a set of interactive questions. Genmenu supports 
  Blackbox, fluxbox, WindowMaker, and Enlightenment window managers.

  I modified the script to make backup copies of original menu files (they will have .orig extention)
