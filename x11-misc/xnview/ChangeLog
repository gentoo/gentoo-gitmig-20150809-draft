  18 Jun 2003; Patrick Kursawe <phosphan@gentoo.org> xnview-1.50.ebuild:
  Fixed download locations (reported in bug 19968)

*xnview-1.50 (12 Feb 2003)

  12 Feb 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ChangeLog
  xnview-1.50.ebuild files/digest-xnview-1.50 :

  An image viewer/converter application, freeware, binary only.  I
  changed the ebuild that Mark Mealman <mmealman@tarsis.org> submitted in
  bug #13584 to download the rpms instead since they are statically
  linked with *motif, removing the necessity of restricting the user to a
  specific version of openmotif (there are binaries for 2.1 and 2.2 and
  lesstif for the dynamically linked ones).  Also, with the rpm's it is
  easier to install for ppc or x86.
