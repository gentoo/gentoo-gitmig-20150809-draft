  26 May 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> netbeans-3.3.2.ebuild,
  netbeans-3.4.1.ebuild, netbeans-3.4.ebuild, files/netbeans:
  Fixed license for J2EE, and in 3.4.1 added a /usr/bin run script to close
  #18928. Doing a symlink was not a good solution as many people symlink /opt to
  other places, and dosym would fail under that circumstance.

  netbeans-3.4.ebuild, files/digest-netbeans-3.4 :

  New major release. Resolves bug 7199 and 7017. Updated ebuild
  contributed by Douglas Pollock <desudation@yahoo.ca>. Added support
  for KDE menus. Updated desktop icon to new dark blue logo.

*netbeans-3.3.2 ( 28 Jun 2002 )

  28 Jun 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org>
  netbeans-3.3.2.ebuild, files/digest-3.3.2 :

  new version released, updated ebuild to comply with present requirements;
  (updated versions were submitted by Tejaswi Kasturi <tej@kasturi.org>
  and Heiko Helmle <helman@gmx.net>).
  Added few licenses under which parts of the package are released, still 
  need to add few more.
  I could not fetch sources from a few locations, however Tejaswi claims 
  he never had difficulty fetching them. Therefore I am committing and masking 
  new version. Will unmask when licenses are all added and SRC_URI checked.

*netbeans-3.3.1 ( 6 Feb 2002 )

  6 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org>
  files/netbeans.desktop files/netbeans.png :
 
  Minor fix in netbeans.desktop so that NetBeans integrates properly with 
  GNOME now.
