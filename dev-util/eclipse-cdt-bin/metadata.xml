The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a fully
functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Eclipse
platform. 

There are a number of groups contributing to the CDT; We strongly encourage
interested parties to extend our work, thereby making the Eclipse CDT project a
richer set of freely available resources. We are looking for contributions from
the open source community in the areas of test, development, documentation, and
general users who can help us ensure that the C/C++ tools work well on all the
Eclipse platforms. 

Our current release function includes:

* C/C++ Editor (basic functionality, syntax highlighting, code completion etc.) 
* C/C++ Debugger (APIs &amp; Default implementation, using GDB) 
* C/C++ Launcher (APIs &amp; Default implementation, launches and external application) 
* Parser
* Search Engine
* Content Assist Provider
* Makefile generator

The CDT is licensed under the Common Public License and is implemented in java
as a set of plugins to the Eclipse platform.
