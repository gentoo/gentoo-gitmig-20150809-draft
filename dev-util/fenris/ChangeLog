*fenris-0.07m (07 Dic 2002)

  07 Dic 2002; Quequero <quequero@bitchx.it> fenris-0.07m.ebuild:
  First import. Ebuild submitted by Quequero <quequero@bitchx.it>.
  Fenris is a multipurpose tracer, GUI debugger, stateful analyzer
  and partial decompiler intended to simplify bug tracking, security
  audits, code, algorithm, protocol analysis and computer forensics
  providing a structural program trace, interactive debugging, general 
  information about internal constructions, execution path, I/O and 
  much more. Because it does not require sources or any particular 
  compilation method, this multi-component project can be very 
  helpful for black-box tests and evaluations but it will also be a 
  reat tool for open-source project audits, as an unmatched real-time 
  reconnaissance tool.
  Installed files and utilities are: fenris, fprints, getfprints,
  ragnarok, fenris-bug, ragsplit, spliter.pl, dress, aegir, nc-aegir.
