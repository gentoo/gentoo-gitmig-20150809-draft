*cucumber-0.3.96 (22 Aug 2009)

  22 Aug 2009; Hans de Graaff <graaff@gentoo.org> +cucumber-0.3.96.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Initial import from my overlay, where is was available as
  dev-ruby/cucumber. I've opted for dev-util in the main tree since Cucumber
  has a much wider application than just testing ruby code.
