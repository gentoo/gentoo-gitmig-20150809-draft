  24 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> cweb-3.63.ebuild files/digest-cweb-3.63 :

  CWEB is a version of WEB for documenting C, C++, and Java programs. WEB was
  adapted to C by Silvio Levy in 1987, and since then both Knuth and Levy have
  revised and enhanced the system in many ways, notably to support C++ and 
  ANSI C. Thus CWEB combines TeX with today's most widely used professional 
  programming languages.
