  13 Apr 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fhist-1.8.ebuild files/digest-fhist-1.8 :

  The FHist package contains 3 utilities, a file history tool ``fhist'', a 
  file comparison tool ``fcomp'', and a file merging tool ``fmerge''. All 
  three are bundled together, because they all use the same minimal-difference
  algorithm.

  The history tool presented here, fhist, is a minimal history tool. It 
  provides no locking or branching. This can be useful in contexts where the 
  configuration management or change control be being provided by some other 
  tool.

  The history tool, fhist is able to handle binary files. The file comparison
  tool, fcomp, usually does a line-for-line plain-text comparison, however it 
  is also capable of a byte-for-byte binary comparison.
