  12 Jul 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> sourcenav-5.1.4.ebuild,
  files/sourcenav-5.1.4-gentoo.diff:
  On behalf of nerdboy@gentoo.org, who writes: updated ebuild for 5.1.4 and
  fixed more sandbox violations. I changed the ebuild to more closely follow the
  standard build procedures (but I guess I don't get a cookie, since my patch
  file is bigger than the previous one).

  Updated the patch to fix the sandbox violation,

  New name and version bump. Found by Nicholas Wourms <nwourms@netscape.net> in #5863.

  30 Oct 2002; S.Jones <cretin@gentoo.org>:

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
