*cscope-15.5 (04 Feb 2004)

  04 Feb 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> cscope-15.5.ebuild,
  metadata.xml:
  Update to cscope-15.5 with KEYWORDS restored from cscope-15.3. It appears
  that somebody doesn't understand how to work with KEYWORDS, or doesn't
  understand how to write a ChangeLog entry explaining their actions.
  cscope-15.5 fixes the bison incompatibility so Brandy's sed fix is no longer
  needed.  Add metadata.xml putting this ebuild into the vim and emacs herds.
