  The BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required
  by most software projects to validate code changes.

  Features:

    * run builds on a variety of slave platforms
    * arbitrary build process: handles projects using C, Python, whatever
    * minimal host requirements: python and Twisted
    * slaves can be behind a firewall if they can still do checkout
    * status delivery through web page, email, IRC, other protocols
    * track builds in progress, provide estimated completion time
    * flexible configuration by subclassing generic build process classes
    * debug tools to force a new build, submit fake Changes, query slave status
    * released under the GPL
