  15 Feb 2004; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> diffstat-1.29.ebuild,
  diffstat-1.34.ebuild, files/diffstat-1.34-hard-locale.patch:
  Added patch for the hard locale fix (codebase didn't seem to change too much,
  I just didn't look hard enough....)

*diffstat-1.34 (15 Feb 2004)

  15 Feb 2004; Joshua Kinard <kumba@gentoo.org> diffstat-1.29.ebuild,
  diffstat-1.34.ebuild:
  Seems we're behind on our versions, so this is an ebuild for the newest
  version, and the 1.29 ebuild has been cleaned up with a better method of
  passing CFLAGS to the makefile. 1.34 doesn't need this makefile hack, however,
  nor does the 1.29 hard-locale patch apply. This may cause Bug #31689 to reopen
  if another patch is needed. The codebase looks to have changed far too much
  between versions for the 1.29 patch to apply.

  31 Oct 2003; Brandy Westcott brandy@gentoo.org diffstat-1.29.ebuild:
  Added patch to allow diffstat to handle hard-locale time format. Thanks to
  Doug Weimer <dweimer@socal.rr.com> for the patch; closes bug #31689.

  14 Sep 2003; David Holm <dholm@gentoo.org> diffstat-1.29.ebuild:
  Added to ~ppc, tested by Daniel Berlin <dberlin@dberlin.org>.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*diffstat-1.29 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
