*kdevelop-2.1.1-r1 (06 Jun 2002)

  06 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  Add some long-requested items: the c/cpp reference package,
  a precompiled kdelibs documentation package (from the kde cvs
  of somewhere in late May) and a premade htdig configuration file
  which may not work optimally but at least gets rid of the annoying
  "no configuration file" error.

  Bugfix release distributed with kde 3.0.1.
  
  24 Apr; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:

  is limited to educational purposes.

*kdevelop-2.1-r2 (23 Apr 2002)

  23 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  Changed K-menu item for kdevelop to include the WANT_AUTOMAKE_1_4=1
  and WANT_AUTOCONF_2_5=1 exports needed for kde3 Makefile.dist autoconf stage

*kdevelop-2.1-r1 (17 Apr 2002)

  17 Apr 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:

  Updated kdoc dependencies to point to the new dev-util/kdoc.

  7 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  Changed qt-docs dependency from >=... to =...*. This makes sure that the qt-docs
  installed is from qt-2.x. This fixes bug #947.

*kdevelop-2.0.2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
