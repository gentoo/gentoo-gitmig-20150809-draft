  10 Jul 2005; Sven Wegener <swegener@gentoo.org> avi-xmms-1.2.3.ebuild,
  avi-xmms-1.2.3-r1.ebuild:
  QA: Removed 'emake || make || die' and variants. Either a package is
  parallel build safe or it is not. There's nothing like trying and falling
  back.

  06 Jul 2004; Jeremy Huddleston <eradicator@gentoo.org>
  avi-xmms-1.2.3-r1.ebuild:
  -* added with note.

  22 Apr 2004; Jeremy Huddleston <eradicator@gentoo.org>

  03 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> avi-xmms-1.2.3-r1.ebuild :
  Masked the package as it causes xmms to crash.

  30 Nov 2002; Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org> ChangeLog,
  avi-xmms-1.2.3-r1.ebuild, files/digest-avi-xmms-1.2.3-r1,
  files/avi-xmms-1.2.3-gcc3-gentoo.patch :

*avi-xmms-1.2.3 (23 Aug 2002)

  30 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> *:

  Relocated to media-plugins

  23 Aug 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avi-xmms-1.2.3.ebuild
  files/digest-avi-xmms-1.2.3 :

  Courtesy of Olle Hällnäs <olle@xmms.org>, a new version of avi-xmms has
  come out, which has avifile statically compiled, so that the system's
  avifile version is independent of this.

*avi-xmms-1.2.2-r3 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> avi-xmms-1.2.2-r3.ebuild :

  This ebuild is now just a virtual package for avi4xmms.  Eventually, avi-xmms
  will be removed completely (unless 4Front Technologies releases a version
  that is compatible with avifile-0.6).

*avi-xmms-1.2.2-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
