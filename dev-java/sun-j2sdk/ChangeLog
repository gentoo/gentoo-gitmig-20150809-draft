  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r3 (21 Nov 2002)

  21 Nov 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r3.ebuild,
  files/digest-sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r3 :
  Switched to the new nsplugins layout.

*sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r2 (12 Nov 2002)

  12 Nov 2002; Stefan A. Jones <cretin@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r2.ebuild:
  This ebuild uses the sun version of motif. Lesstif was causing quite a
  few crashes. During the emerge openmotif and lesstif must be unmerged
  to stop java linking to the bad versions.

*sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r1 (07 Nov 2002)

  12 Nov 2002; Stefan A. Jones <cretin@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r1.ebuild:
  Forced the new revision of lesstif as I think it caused a few crashes as
  java could be linking to a dynamic version as the static lib might not
  be present. The new lesstif version builds the static library.

  11 Nov 2002; Stefan A. Jones <cretin@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r1.ebuild:
  Added some checks for valid versions of jdk and OTHER_C(XX)FLAGS hint.
  
  09 Nov 2002; Stefan A. Jones <cretin@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r1.ebuild:
  Fixed bugs #10489 and #10485 with luck

  07 Nov 2002; Stefan A. Jones <cretin@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0-r1.ebuild:
  This *should* work, please test and fix, and report abuse to me!

*sun-j2sdk-1.4.0 (29 Aug 2002)

  29 Aug 2002; Preston A. Elder <prez@gentoo.org> sun-j2sdk-1.4.0.ebuild:
  Initial check in, it doesnt work, but at lease we can work on it.
