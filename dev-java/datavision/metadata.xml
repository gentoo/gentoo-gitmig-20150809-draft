DataVision is an Open Source reporting tool similar to Crystal Reports. Reports 
can be designed using a drag-and-drop GUI. They may be run, viewed, and printed 
from the application or exported as HTML, XML, PDF, LaTeX2e, DocBook, or tab- or 
comma-delimited text files. The output files produced by LaTeX2e and DocBook can 
in turn be used to produce PDF, text, HTML, PostScript, and more.

DataVision is written in Java and runs almost anywhere. It can generate reports 
from databases or text data files. Any database with an available JDBC driver 
should work: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Informix, hsqldb, Microsoft Access, 
Progress, and more. Columns read from text files can be separated by any 
character.

Report descriptions are stored as XML files. This means you can not only use the 
DataVision GUI but you may also edit reports using your favorite text editor.
