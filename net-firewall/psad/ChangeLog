*psad-1.4.0 (01 Dec 2004)

  01 Dec 2004; Bryan D. Stine <battousai@gentoo.org> +psad-1.3.4.ebuild,
  +psad-1.4.0.ebuild:
  I need to keep up with the bumps better. The latest two bumps close #69263
  (thanks Daniel Webert) and #72990 (thanks Alexey Portnov). The new upstream
  version have changed the init-script locations in the tarballs, so the
  ebuilds were updated accordingly.

  08 Aug 2004; Tom Martin <slarti@gentoo.org> psad-1.3.1.ebuild,
  psad-1.3.2.ebuild:
  Typo in DESCRIPTION: Scannning -> Scanning. Bug 59717.

*psad-1.3.2 (24 Jun 2004)

  24 Jun 2004; Bryan Stine <battousai@gentoo.org>; psad-1.3.1.ebuild,
  +psad-1.3.2.ebuild:
  Version bump to new 1.3.2 release. This release also resulted in a few
  rewritten installation instructions and some changed filenames. Also changed
  /etc/init.d doins stuff to doexe.

  21 Jun 2004; Bryan Stine <battousai@gentoo.org>; psad-1.3.1.ebuild:
  The ebuild now installs manfiles. Thanks to Michael Rash for pointing this out.

  23 Mar 2004; Bryan Stine <battousai@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild,
  psad-1.3.1.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:
  Expunged old ebuilds. Bumping 1.3.1 to x86 stable, but need to wait on deps
  for the other arches.

  02 Feb 2004; Bryan Stine <battousai@gentoo.org>; psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild,
  psad-1.3.1.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:

  13 Jan 2004; Bryan Stine <battousai@gentoo.org> psad-1.3.1.ebuild,
  psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:
  Version bump. Thanks to seemant for helping me maintain this before now.
  Also, hppa, mips, ia64 and arm have been removed from KEYWORDS. Runtime
  dependencies are not yet available for those architectures.

*psad-1.3 (01 Dec 2003)

  01 Dec 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.3-r1.ebuild,
  psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild, psad-1.2.4.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:
  version bump, and moved 1.2.4-r1 to stable x86.  The usual Battoussai
  acknowledgement here :)

*psad-1.2.4-r1 (28 Oct 2003)

  28 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild,
  files/psad-1.2.4-metalog.patch:
  new patch to make psad work better with metalog. The patch was written by:
  Dennis Freise <cat@final-frontier.ath.cx> and sent to psad's upstream author
  and myself. Battoussai rediff'd it and updated the ebuild for us.

*psad-1.2.4 (20 Oct 2003)

  20 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4.ebuild:
  version bump, with fixes: This one seds the machine's hostname (based on
  /etc/hostname and /etc/dnsdomainname) into the psad.conf file. I also fixed a
  problem regarding the perl modules bundled with psad (they needed to be put
  into subdirs of the /usr/lib/psad directory). And finally, diskmond has been
  removed from the package -- All this work was done by Battoussai.

*psad-1.2.3-r1 (06 Oct 2003)

  06 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.3-r1.ebuild:
  Moved bundled PERL module locations to /usr/lib/psad to avoid conflicts with
  the system PERL tree -- thanks again to Battoussai

  19 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :
  version bump, thanks again to Battoussai (Bryan Stine <admin@kentonet.net>)

*psad-1.2.1 (17 Sep 2003)

  17 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.1.ebuild:
  Port Scanning Attack Detection daemon. This is a dependency of Bastille, and
  probably can be used standalone as well. Much thanks to Battoussai (Bryan
  Stine <admin@kentonet.net>) for this.
