*psad-1.2.4 (20 Oct 2003)

  20 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4.ebuild:
  version bump, with fixes: This one seds the machine's hostname (based on
  /etc/hostname and /etc/dnsdomainname) into the psad.conf file. I also fixed a
  problem regarding the perl modules bundled with psad (they needed to be put
  into subdirs of the /usr/lib/psad directory). And finally, diskmond has been
  removed from the package

*psad-1.2.3-r1 (06 Oct 2003)

  06 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.3-r1.ebuild:
  Moved bundled PERL module locations to /usr/lib/psad to avoid conflicts with
  the system PERL tree -- thanks again to Battoussai

  19 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :
  version bump, thanks again to Battoussai (Bryan Stine <admin@kentonet.net>)

*psad-1.2.1 (17 Sep 2003)

  17 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.1.ebuild:
  Port Scanning Attack Detection daemon. This is a dependency of Bastille, and
  probably can be used standalone as well. Much thanks to Battoussai (Bryan
  Stine <admin@kentonet.net>) for this.
