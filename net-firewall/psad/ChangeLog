  psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:
  Version bump. Thanks to seemant for helping me maintain this before now.
  Also, hppa, mips, ia64 and arm have been removed from KEYWORDS. Runtime
  dependencies are not yet available for those architectures.

*psad-1.3 (01 Dec 2003)

  01 Dec 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.3-r1.ebuild,
  psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild, psad-1.2.4.ebuild, psad-1.3.ebuild:
  version bump, and moved 1.2.4-r1 to stable x86.  The usual Battoussai
  acknowledgement here :)

*psad-1.2.4-r1 (28 Oct 2003)

  28 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4-r1.ebuild,
  files/psad-1.2.4-metalog.patch:
  new patch to make psad work better with metalog. The patch was written by:
  Dennis Freise <cat@final-frontier.ath.cx> and sent to psad's upstream author
  and myself. Battoussai rediff'd it and updated the ebuild for us.

*psad-1.2.4 (20 Oct 2003)

  20 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.4.ebuild:
  version bump, with fixes: This one seds the machine's hostname (based on
  /etc/hostname and /etc/dnsdomainname) into the psad.conf file. I also fixed a
  problem regarding the perl modules bundled with psad (they needed to be put
  into subdirs of the /usr/lib/psad directory). And finally, diskmond has been
  removed from the package -- All this work was done by Battoussai.

*psad-1.2.3-r1 (06 Oct 2003)

  06 Oct 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.3-r1.ebuild:
  Moved bundled PERL module locations to /usr/lib/psad to avoid conflicts with
  the system PERL tree -- thanks again to Battoussai

  19 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :
  version bump, thanks again to Battoussai (Bryan Stine <admin@kentonet.net>)

*psad-1.2.1 (17 Sep 2003)

  17 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> psad-1.2.1.ebuild:
  Port Scanning Attack Detection daemon. This is a dependency of Bastille, and
  probably can be used standalone as well. Much thanks to Battoussai (Bryan
  Stine <admin@kentonet.net>) for this.
