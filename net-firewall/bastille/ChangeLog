  02 Aug 2003; <solar@gentoo.org> bastille-2.1.1.ebuild:
  Added support for console only building. Server installs are a place
  that I think most admins/users would want the functionality of something 
  like bastille without having to install X

*bastille-2.1.1 (02 Aug 2003)

  02 Aug 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> bastille-2.1.1.ebuild,
  files/bastille-2.1.1.patch:

  by the venerable: Bryan Stine <admin@kentonet.net>
