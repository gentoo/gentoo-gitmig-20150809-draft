  First submission
  From the ebuild author:

  KMyFirewall is a GUI interface to the "iptables" netfilter administration  
  tool written for KDE which now has support for thg Gentoo Linux init system.  
  It provides an XML - like file format for import/export rulesets to ease the  
  setup of large networks.   
  There is also a Wizard which enables you to set up a simple "Personal  
  Firewall" within a few clicks. 
  At the moment most filtering options (provided by iptables) are implemented.  
  The support for Target Ectentions will be added soon.
