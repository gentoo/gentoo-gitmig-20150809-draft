# Command to run to set the clock initially
# Most people should just leave this line alone ...
# however, if you know what you're doing, and you
# want to use ntpd to set the clock, change this to 'ntpd'
NTPCLIENT_CMD="ntpdate"

# Options to pass to the above command
# Most people should just uncomment this variable and
# change 'someserver' to a valid hostname which you
# can aquire from the URL's below
#NTPCLIENT_OPTS="-b someserver"

##
# A list of available servers is available here:
# http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/servers.html
# Please follow the rules of engagement and use a
# Stratum 2 server (unless you qualify for Stratum 1)
