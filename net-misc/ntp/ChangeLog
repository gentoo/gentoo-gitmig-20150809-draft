*ntp-4.1.1a (1 May 2002)
  1 May 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> ntp-4.1.72-r2.ebuild :
  Create 4.1.1a ebuild and mask 4.1.72* versions, the 4.1.72* versions
  are *alpha* releases for 4.2.0, and have trouble building on some
  hosts.
  
  This should finally close 1882

*ntp-4.1.72-r2 (28 Apr 2002)
  28 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> ntp-4.1.72-r2.ebuild :

  Remove -lncurses from LDFLAGS environment, it screws up
  the build.
  If there is a good reason for it to be there, prefix it with
   -L/lib so that configure can find it there (it's not in /usr/lib).
  Closes bug #1882 and allows compilation
  Update ebuild for lintool compliance
  
*ntp-4.1.72-r1 (24 March 2002)
  
  24 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :

  Resolve bug #897 (add ntpdate to rc-script); add config file for ntpd.

*ntp-4.1.72 (1 Feb 2002)

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
