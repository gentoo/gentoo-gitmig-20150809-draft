	Cfengine, or the configuration engine is an autonomous agent and a middle to
	high level policy language for building expert systems which administrate
	and configure large computer networks. Cfengine uses the idea of classes and
	a primitive intelligence to define and automate the configuration and
	maintenance of system state, for small to huge configurations. Cfengine is
	designed to be a part of a computer immune system, and can be thought of as
	a gaming agent. It is ideal for cluster management and has been adopted for
	use all over the world in small and huge organizations alike.
