*vnc-3.3.3-r3 (03 Sep 2002)

  03 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vnc-3.3.3-r3.ebuild
  files/digest-vnc-3.3.3-r3 :

  Added a bunch of packages, courtesy of Mandrake's src.rpm.  The following
  patches are applied: imake, xauth, tightvnc encoding, using xinit's
  XClients script to start the session, vncpassword creates ~/.vnc if
  non-existent, system libs (zlib) and shared memory patch.  Additionally,
  there is a patch to let it use the X font server (closing bug #6614 by:
  kelsall@dsl.pipex.com (Chris Paulson-Ellis)) and a patch to compile even
  though the manpage isn';t present (closing bug #7365 by: gentoo@inrevo.com
  (Alistair McDonald)).  Additionally, an optional patch is applied if
  "tcpd" is in USE to use tcp wrappers.  Finally, for ppc users a patch is
  applied so that vnc is compilable/installable/runnable on ppc systems.

*vnc-3.3.3-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> vnc-3.3.3-r2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS, LICENSE, SLOT, DESCRIPTION.

  11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vnc-3.3.3-r2.ebuild :
  Added X as a dependency since xmkmf is required for compilation, and that is
  provided by X (and openmotif, but that is pointless).  Also, brought ebuild's
  syntax up to date.  No revision bump necessary.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
