*openssh-3.4_p1-r3 (04 July 2002)

  25 Jul 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r3.ebuild :
	
  Bopped Brandon on the head. Added -passwords to the end of --with-md5
  No version bump as this doesn't affect most people, and those who need it
  can just rsync and emerge.

  09 Jul 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r3.ebuild :

  New revision enables md5 passwords, please test and let me know how it
  goes so I can unmask.  Thanks.

*openssh-3.4_p1-r2 (04 July 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS.

  04 July 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r2.ebuild :
  Fixes problem of /var/empty being removed if immediately do emerge openssh
  emerge openssh.  Not an urgent upgrade, but recommended.

*openssh-3.4_p1-r1 (02 July 2002)

  02 July 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r1.ebuild :
  This closes bugs 4169, 4170, and 4193.  This new ebuild changes the sshd
  user from whatever it may be to UID 22, this shouldn't mean anything to most
  people because no scripts, nor programs use the sshd UID directly (for that
  matter it is only referenced during authentication of new logins via ssh). 
  However if for some reason your system does have things that were owned by
  user sshd, you will need to change their UID.

*openssh-3.4_p1 (26 June 2002)

  26 June 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> :
  New version closes soon to be released security hole, PLEASE upgrade
	immediately according to the changelogs, this new version closes several
	possible holes found during a massive audit of the code.

*openssh-3.3_p1 (22 June 2002)

  process separation scheme.  See the docs for more info.

  5 June 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> :

  sshd file to use pam_stack, pam_nologin and pam_shells, as well as use
  pam_unix instead of pam_pwdb.  Added updated shadow dependency if pam is
  enabled (to depend upon our new shadow with the pam_pwdb to pam_unix
  conversion).

*openssh-3.1_p1 (7 Mar 2002)

  15 Mar 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> files/sshd.rc6 files/sshd.rc5 :
