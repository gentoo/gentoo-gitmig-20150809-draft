*openssh-3.4_p1-r1 (02 July 2002)

  02 July 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> openssh-3.4_p1-r1.ebuild:
  This closes bugs 4169, 4170, and 4193.  This new ebuild changes the sshd
  user from whatever it may be to UID 22, this shouldn't mean anything to most
  people because no scripts, nor programs use the sshd UID directly (for that
  matter it is only referenced during authentication of new logins via ssh). 
  However if for some reason your system does have things that were owned by
  user sshd, you will need to change their UID.

  process separation scheme.  See the docs for more info.
