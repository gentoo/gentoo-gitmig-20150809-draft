  Lee Howard <faxguy@deanox.com> from the hylafax-users mailing list informed
  me that drobbins' patch to make the configure script work with sed-3.02.80
  (as posted on hylafax's bugzilla by g2boojum) was a tad incomplete.  He 
  graciously completed it et voila! successful emerge without having to compile
  a static sed-3.02 :)  Many thanks to him.

  Updated to newest stable release.  This is a pain to build because it requires
  a lower GNU/sed version than we have in portage.  So, GNU/sed-3.02 is fetched
  and built statically, so that it can be used to configure hylafax.  The
  other patches are taken from Mandrake's srpm for 4.1.1, but seems to work well
  with this.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog : 

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
