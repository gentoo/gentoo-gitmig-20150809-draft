  <longdescription>Quagga is a modern fork of Zebra. Quagga is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, BGP-4, and BGP-4+ (*note Supported RFC::). Quagga also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.  In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Quagga also supports IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX protocol, Quagga provides routing protocol MIBs (*note SNMP Support::). Furthermore Quagga supports OSPFAPI (*note OSPFAPI Support::), a API interface to the OSPF LSDB. It supports inspection as well as injection of normal and opaque OSPF LSAs. Applications like SRRD - The Service Rounting Redundancy Daemon - can make use of OSPFAPI to inject opaque data into the OSPF routing domain. SRRD, for example, implements a cluster server by using the OSPFAPI to flood service state information into the routing domain.</longdescription>
