*omniORB-305 (25 Jul 2002)

  09 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> omniORB-305.ebuild :

  fixed the ldconfig complaint issue: 
  this version was creating symlinks to the libs and dolib was copying them 
  as regular files. Changed to cp -d

  one issue remains:
  ebuild omniORB-305.ebuild qmerge   or  emerge omniORB -b  will break while 
  invokying pkg_postinst function - FILESDIR gets assigned path under ${D} instead 
  of the right one (plain emerge works fine)
  However this is a portage issue (and has been noticed for a few other packages)
  Submitted a bug report, should go away as it gets fixed in portage.

  08 Aug 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> files/omniORB.305 omniORB-305.ebuild :
  Bumped the init.d file to omniORB.305; removed notifd from and fixed the killall command.
  Incorporated this change in the ebuild.

  25 Jul 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> omniORB-305.ebuild :

  new version
  fixes few bugs. Also omniORBpy is included, however omniNotify 
  is not (and is absent form the site)
  BTW, omniORB is now on sourceforge, old location looks deserted for some time.

  sandbox violation in omniORB-304-r6.ebuild reported by Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
  corrected omniORB-304-r6.ebuild and mkomnistubs submitted by Matthias Sessler <matthias204@mac.com>
