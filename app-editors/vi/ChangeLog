*vi-3.7-r3 (05 Sep 2002)

  05 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Add libtermcap-compat to DEPEND.

*vi-3.7-r2 (06 Aug 2002)

  06 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Change it to use the buildin termlib instead of ncurses.  This should
  fix segfaults in console with TERM=linux.  It now requires /etc/termcap,
  but I added http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/distfiles/termcap.bz2, and
  will also add it to baselayout.

*vi-3.7-r1 (12 May 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :
  Added KEYWORDS.


  12 May 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> :
  Added a addpredict line to hopefully fix 3038.  Which is a sandbox violation
  that seems to occur when logged in via ssh and trying to merge vi.  The
  pacakge tries to access /dev/pty/s6.
    

*vi-3.7 (12 May 2002)
  12 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> :
  Now that I've added the Caldera LICENSE I'm changing this one too  

*vi-3.7  (12 May 2002)
  12 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> ChangeLog vi-3.7.ebuild :
  Classical vi added to portage!! 
  The ebuild does some make oddities, but is generally clean (better to set them at make time than to patch/sed )
