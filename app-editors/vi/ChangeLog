vi-3.7-r1 (12 May 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.


  12 May 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> :
    Added a addpredict line to hopefully fix 3038.  Which is a sandbox violation
    that seems to occur when logged in via ssh and trying to merge vi.  The
    pacakge tries to access /dev/pty/s6.
    

vi-3.7 (12 May 2002)
  12 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> :
  Now that I've added the Caldera LICENSE I'm changing this one too  

*vi-3.7  (12 May 2002)
  12 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> ChangeLog vi-3.7.ebuild :
  Classical vi added to portage!! 
  The ebuild does some make oddities, but is generally clean (better to set them at make time than to patch/sed )
