  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.


	11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> nano-1.0.8-r1.ebuild :

	I did not bump the revision number of this, but I added a flag to 
	disable text wrapping as root, for when nano is built for the bootcd
	or build environments.  This means that the nano -w instruction in
	our Gentoo Installation docs will need to be adjusted to just say
	"nano" now.  Thanks to chrisa@asty.org (Chris Allegretta) in bug
	# 1565

	1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
	
	Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
	updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
	the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
	details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
	skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
	portage repository.
