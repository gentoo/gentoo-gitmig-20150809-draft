  XEmacs "gamma" ebuild. New ebuild. 

  From http://www.xemacs.org/Releases/index.html#Gamma:

  "The gamma series of releases is satisfactorily stable for most
  sophisticated users. Most Linux or *BSD users should get the best
  results from the gamma series, and we strongly recommend it to the
  ``tester'' distributions like NetBSD current, Debian sid, Mandrake
  Cooker, Red Hat Rawhide, and so on. XEmacs will be ready when they
  are!"

  "The gamma series of releases is the candidate for promotion to a
  stable series. Although we do not promote the code base to gamma
  while there are known critical bugs in the code base, to attempt to
  meet schedules we also do promote fairly quickly once we've fixed
  the last known critical bug. Everybody does this, and everybody
  knows that despite the best efforts of the developers, ``point oh''
  releases typically still have bugs in them. The gamma concept simply
  acknowledges this."

  "The gamma concept allows us to expand our tester base substantially
  beyond our dedicated beta testers, while warning the administrators
  or users that we still acknowledge some risk of more or less serious
  bugs we don't yet know about. It also offers the kinds of users who
  use ``tester'' Linux distributions a much more featureful
  application with low, but not absolutely minimal, risk."

  "The gamma series receives active attention on a daily basis from
  the core developers. Important bugs that do not imply data loss,
  including problems with font-locking in C and Lisp modes will be
  addressed in the gamma series. Low-risk fixes that provide most of
  the missing functionality are the priority. The primary goal is
  strictly increasing stability. Improved functionality consistent
  with improving stability is secondary, and basically limited to the
  as-yet immature MS Windows port. All changes must be approved by the
  21.4 Release Manager, Stephen Turnbull."

  "Users of the gamma series should read the release announcement, and
  the NEWS and PROBLEMS files carefully, as many of the known issues
  will not yet be reflected in the FAQ or Info documentation."
