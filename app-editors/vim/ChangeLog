*vim-6.1-r2 (7 Apr 2002)

	7 Apr 2002; Jared H. Hudson <jhhudso@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r2.ebuild :

	Removed "addpredict /dev/vc/" from ebuild, portage-1.8.17 now
	includes /dev/vc/ in sandbox as a default writable directory,
	as it did with /dev/pts/ before 1.8.17.

*vim-6.1-r1 (4 Apr 2002)

	4 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1-r1.ebuild :

	This is a dirty hack, in my opinion, to bypass the sandbox violation
	errors on the /dev/vc/*.  I think this is a portage bug more than
	a vim  bug because it happens for new to 1.0 users.

*vim-6.1 (30 Mar 2002)

	30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> vim-6.1.ebuild

	Resolved bug 1426: SRC_URI points primarily to ftp.vim.org instead
	of ftp.us.vim.org which no longer contains the tar ball for 6.1
	Thanks to jnelson@jamponi.net

*vim-6.1 (26 Mar 2002)

	26 Mar 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r6.ebuild, vim-6.1.ebuild:

	Resolved bug 1335: vim 6.1 released
	Resolved bug 1293: vim python support disabled

*vim-6.0-r5 (19 Feb 2002)

	19 Feb 2002; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> vim-6.0-r5.ebuild:

	Resolved bug 583: "patch to vim-6.0-r4 to install a vimrc in
	/usr/share/vim instead of /etc/skel/.vimrc".  Additionally install
	a default, reasonable gvimrc.  Updated vim to 6.0.223 with all
	available patches.

*vim-6.0-r4 (1 Feb 2002)

	1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

	Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
	updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that
	the comments should well explained and written in clean English. The
	details about writing correct changelogs are explained in the
	skel.ChangeLog file which you can find in the root directory of the
	portage repository.
