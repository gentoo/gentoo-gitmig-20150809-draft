  31 Oct 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  -xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild, xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  Depend on virtual/cdrtools instead of app-cdr/cdrtools. Make this package a
  member of the media-optical herd. Furthermore cleanup.

  17 Jun 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  Edited the dependency list, so that GTK+ will not be installed, when GTK2+ is
  chosen.

  12 Feb 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  There was still an error in the symlink...

  08 Feb 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  Fixed a small typo in the symlink to cdrecord-ProDVD.

  07 Feb 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  stable on x86 and ppc.

  23 Jan 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  Inserted upstream-patch for amd64.  See bug #36676.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3 (17 Jan 2004)

  17 Jan 2004; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild,
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r3.ebuild:
  Made slightly changes in alpha15-r3 as cdrecord-prodvd became a package by
  it's own. Bumped alpha15-r2 stable for x86 and ppc.

  18 Dec 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild:
  Added ~sparc keyword.

  05 Dec 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild:
  Added support for Gnome users, so that X-CD-Roast is in the Multimedia-menu
  and carries it's an icon. This closes bugs 34751 and 34756.

  22 Nov 2003; <spider@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r1.ebuild,
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild, xcdroast-0.98_alpha15.ebuild:
  removed bad gtk?() dependency (as the app doesn't build without gtk (some
  version) it shouldnt have a gtk?( ) flag in the DEPEND statement)

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2 (15 Nov 2003)

  15 Nov 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r2.ebuild:
  Added two patches from xcdroast.org that fixes problems with gtk2 and the
  not-needed pcre-lib.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r1 (02 Nov 2003)

  02 Nov 2003; Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> 
  files/xcdroast-0.98alpha15-dvd.patch :
  Added the patch to let xcdroast use cdrtools + dvdr patches for dvd burning.

  02 Nov 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha15-r1.ebuild:
  DVD-support uses cdrecord-ProDVD. This is closed-source software, but it works
  and free for use for educational, research and private purposes. A key has to
  be typed in to X-CD-Roast. See ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/ProDVD/README
  and http://www.xcdroast.org/xcdr098/README.ProDVD.txt for further information.

  31 Oct 2003; Martin Holzer <mholzer@gentoo.org>
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha15.ebuild:
  adding dev-libs/libpcre. closes #32372.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha15 (31 Oct 2003)

  31 Oct 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r2.ebuild,
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha15.ebuild:
  Version bump. Thanks to Mario Vazquez for the ebuild. X-CD-Roast now supports
  gtk2.
  
  Changed the SRC_URI for the patches in the alpha14-ebuild, as they changed
  with the alpha15-release.

  28 Oct 2003; Bartosch Pixa <darkspecter@gentoo.org>
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r2.ebuild:
  set ppc in keywords

  11 Sep 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r2.ebuild:
  New USE flag 'dvdr'. That will apply a patch to xcdroast that makes use of
  cdrtools' patch for DVD-writing.
  
  Nevertheless xcdroast has full support for cdrecord-ProDVD
  (http://www.xcdroast.org/xcdr098/README.ProDVD.txt), which has to be
  installed manually. Maybe I'll automate it with an ebuild later.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r2 (04 Sep 2003)

  04 Sep 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha10-r3.ebuild,
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r2.ebuild, xcdroast-0.98_alpha14.ebuild,
  files/xcdroast-0.98alpha14-dvd.patch:

  Applied suggestions from Bug #26323.
  
  xcdroast makes now use of the USE-flag "dvd" which will compile it with
  further DVD-write functionalities.  If this is to much overload for users
  who only want DVD-read functionalities (and have set this USE-flag by
  default), this USE-flag should be renamed and become a local one.

  Removed some old ebuilds.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r1 (17 Jul 2003)

  17 Jul 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha14-r1.ebuild:
  Adding two patches from the xcdroast author as described in Bug 22042. Thanks
  to digex@web.de for the ebuild.
  
  Further masking stable on ppc.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha14 (14 Jun 2003)

  14 Jun 2003; Lars Weiler <pylon@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha13.ebuild,
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha14.ebuild:
  Masked alpha13 stable on x86.
  
  Added new version alpha14.

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha10 (16 Jun 2002)
  
  21 Oct 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@gentoo.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha10-r2 :
  xcdroast does not work with cdrtools above 1.11.33.

  16 Jun 2002; Doug Goldstein (Cardoe) <dougg@ufl.edu>
  xcdroast-0.98_alpha10-r2.ebuild: Changed the depends to the new version of
  cdrtools because of bugs reports and because the xcdroast site says there are
  bugs unless you use the latest version.  Fixed lintool errors too. :)

  4 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org>  xcdroast-0.98_alpha10-r1.ebuild:

  16 Apr 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> xcdroast-0.98_alpha9-r1.ebuild:
  Fixed xcdroast's hardcoded dependency versions to work with a newer version 
  of cdrtools (hardcoding is because of xcdroast itself, not our packaging)

*xcdroast-0.98_alpha9 (11 Apr 2002)

  11 Apr 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org>
  Update all glib dependencies to use glib-1.2*  in preparation of unmasking the glib-2.0.1 packages
