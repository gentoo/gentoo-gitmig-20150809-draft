*apache-1.3.24-r1 (9 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> apache-1.3.24-r1.ebuild :
  data is now in /home/httpd/{htdocs,icons,cgi-bin} (new standard location for Gentoo)
  server now runs as user/group apache
  mod_ssl was split into a separate package
  link with the mm library; provides modules with shared memory pools (EAPI_MM=SYSTEM)
  link with the system expat library
  all modules are now built using SHARED_CHAIN (smaller mod sizes)
  several patches from debian/mandrake are included.  the most interesting one is the
  mandrake serverroot patch which makes configuring and organizing apache easier.
  the EAPI patch is now unconditionally included.  previously you only got it if you
  had ssl in your USE variable.
  provide an easy way to tune up the HARD_SERVER_LIMIT
  created a build-time config file for the modules distributed with apache.  now you
  can finely tune your own modules selection, and have your choices preserved across
  upgrades.  a gentoo-only feature ;)
  suexec is now fixed and restricted to user/group apache.
  added some support scripts (from mandrake).  two of these allow easy addition and
  removal of third-party modules into your apache.conf.  this should make writing
  ebuilds for extra mods easier.  see net-www/mod_* for examples.
  the config files are now in /etc/apache/conf, conveniently organized into
  separate directories for addon-modules and vhosts.  this simplifies things for
  everybody and especially for those with complicated/large sites.

*apache-1.3.24 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> apache-1.3.24.ebuild :

  being re-written, will be ready soon.

*apache-1.3.23 (4 Feb 2002)

  4 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> apache-1.3.23.ebuild :
  Bump apache to 1.3.23, mod_ssl to 2.8.6-1.3.23.

*apache-1.3.22-r6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
