# $Header: /var/cvsroot/gentoo-x86/net-www/apache/files/2.0.49/apache2-builtin-mods,v 1.1 2004/03/22 21:17:57 stuart Exp $
#
# This file will be installed into /etc/apache2 when you first emerge
# Apache2.  If/when you upgrade, it will be consulted for your options,
# thus preserving your previous configuration.  The default configuration
# in files/ is used if the one in /etc/apache2 isn't available.
#
# To compile a module statically into the apache binary, simply put
# static beside it.  To compile a module as a DSO, put shared beside
# it.  To disable a module, simply put a - as the first character on
# the line.
#
# Examples:
# mod_access shared    ( this would build a DSO )
# mod_actions static   ( this would get compiled statically )
# - mod_alias shared   ( this module would not be built at all )
#
# Please be aware that if you _do_ customize these then you'll need
# to manually adjust your apache2.conf file, tweaking the LoadModule
# lines accordingly or else your server will fail to start; you've
# been warned! (woodchip@gentoo.org  Nov 21 2002)
