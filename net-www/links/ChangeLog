  11 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> links-2.1_pre2-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-links-2.1_pre2-r2 :

  From: kevin@aptbasilicata.it (Maurizio Disimino) in bug # 7809

  at the moment, links will be compiled with --enable-graphics only if
  USE="png". If --enable-graphics is not supplied, fb WILL NOT WORK.
  Moreover, --enable-graphis should be enabled for 'X' or 'fbcon'.

  Note: if X or fbcon usegflag are enabled, links will be built in 
  graphic mode. libpng is required to compile links in graphic mode 
  not required in textmode),so let's add libpng for X? and fbcon?

     X? ( virtual/x11 >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.1 )
	    fbcon? ( >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.1 )"

		- Fixed DEPEND and src_compile().
		- Some cosmetic changes.

  22 Jul 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> links-0.96-r2.ebuild :

  21 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> links-2.1_pre2-r1.ebuild
