*tomcat-4.1.24-r1 (27 May 2003)

  27 May 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> tomcat-4.1.24-r1.ebuild:
  /opt/tomcat/conf was vulnerable to local users who are snooping the
  tomcat-users.xml file for passwords. The new ebuild fixes this problem for new
  installations.
  
  If you have an existing installation of Tomcat you can do the following:
  
  1. # /etc/init.d/tomcat stop
  2. # chmod -R 750 /opt/tomcat/
  3. # /etc/init.d/tomcat start
  
  Thanks to "D.Tuinstra" <tuinstra@inteo.com> for pointing out the
  vulnerability.

*tomcat-4.1.24 (25 Mar 2003)

  Minor fix to pkg_postinst() comments; fix to env.d/21tomcat install;
  added RDEPEND for sed.

  06 Apr 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> tomcat-4.1.24.ebuild:
  x86 ppc sparc moved to stable.

  28 Mar 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> files/4.1.24/tomcat.conf:
  Fixed sed path in conf.d/tomcat.

  25 Mar 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> omcat-4.1.24.ebuild, 
  files/4.1.24/21tomcat, tomcat-4.1.24.ebuild, files/4.1.24/21tomcat,
  files/4.1.24/gentoo.diff, files/4.1.24/tomcat.conf, files/4.1.24/tomcat.init:
  Version bump.  
  
  Also a few changes thanks to user feedback from Anthony Murray: 
  Fixes to init script, and changed conf.d/JAVA_HOME back to automatically
  set itself.  Closes bug #17907.

*tomcat-4.1.18-r1 (22 Mar 2003)

  22 Mar 2003; Dylan Carlson <absinthe@gentoo.org> tomcat-4.1.18-r1.ebuild,
  files/4.1.18/gentoo.diff, files/4.1.18/tomcat.conf,
  files/4.1.18/tomcat.init:
  Significant changes.  This ebuild now bears close resemblance to 
  net-www/orion.
  
  1. Tomcat now runs as user 'tomcat' by default. 
  2. All classes and JARs get installed into /usr/share/tomcat. 
  3. All logs go to /var/log/tomcat. 
  4. Init script was modified to use JAVA_HOME as set in /etc/conf.d/tomcat. 
     This is because we don't want the init script making any assumptions as 
     to what JVM the user wants to run for Tomcat. 
  5. JSSE and JPDA are supported as startup modes in /etc/conf.d/tomcat. 
     ( If you have a Sun Java 1.4 SDK or later, you have JSSE and JPDA 
     included. )
  
  Feedback on these changes would be appreciated, so we can get this
  ebuild moved to stable.
