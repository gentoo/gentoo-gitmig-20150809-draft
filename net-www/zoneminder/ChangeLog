*zoneminder-0.9.12 (20 Jun 2003)

  20 Jun 2003; mkeadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> zoneminder-0.9.12.ebuild:
  initial import. very impressive program. much thanks go to MAL
  <mal@komcept.com> for putting this all together very well in bug #22665. MALs
  ebuild used its own internal vars to track where to install the web content. I
  switched this over to the datadir format used by the apache ebuilds. This lets
  zoneminder install to the same location apache was installed to without user
  interaction, but still leaves the door open for customization.
