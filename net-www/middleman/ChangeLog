*middleman-1.9 (11 Sep 2003)

  11 Sep 2003; <solar@gentoo.org> middleman-1.9.ebuild:
  version bumpage, The changes in this release are as follows:
  Support for ICP (Internet cache protocol) was  added, making it
  possible to arrange several  proxies in a hierarchy and share cached
  objects.  It is now possible to specify multiple  directories for
  cached objects to be stored. The  'Host' and 'File' options in most
  configuration  sections were removed in favor of enabling/ disable
  profiles based on the URL requested. A  workaround was added for a
  bug triggered by  improper headers sent by Apache 1.3 when a  tar.gz
  file was requested by a client that  doesn't support gzip
  compression.
