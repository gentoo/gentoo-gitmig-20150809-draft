*w3m-0.3-r2 (07 Jun 2002)

    14 Jul 2002; Michael Nazaroff <naz@gentoo.org> w3m-0.3-r3.ebuild:

	Updated the ebuild and changed the configure options so mouse support
	is always on.  This should take care of bug 4701.  I probably need to 
	look at a patch so we can have a gpm use variable in this ebuild, since
	it still is flaky.
