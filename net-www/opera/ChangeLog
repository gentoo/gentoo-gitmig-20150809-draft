*opera-5.0-r2
 opera-6.0_pre3-r1 (3 Feb 2002)

  3 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added fix for bug #508 to both 5.0 and 6.0_pre3 ebuilds. This fixes the incorrect
  dependency, which installed QT3 instead of QT2.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
