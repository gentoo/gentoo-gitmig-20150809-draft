*gconf-1.1.11-r1 (04 Jun 2002)

  04 Jun 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> gconf-1.1.11-r1.ebuild:

  Converted to gnome2.eclass

*gconf-1.1.11 (3 June 2002)

  3 june 2002; Gabriele Giorgetti <stroke@gentoo.org> gconf-1.1.11.ebuild : 

  New version


  30 May 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> gconf-1.1.10-r1.ebuild,gconf-1.0.8-r3.ebuild:

  Added SLOTS to gconf 1.0.x and 1.1.x... Merging gconf 1.1.x and doing
  an "emerge clean" would result in gconf 1.0.x being unmerged and breaking
  many Gnome 1.4 applications (such as Galeon)

*gconf-1.1.10-r1 (24 May 2002)
  24 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gconf-1.1.10-r1.ebuild :
  Removed the install schemas, this version of gconf doesn't have any
schemas, so this caused a bug when you didn't have an older gconf
version installed


*gconf-1.1.10 (22 May 2002)
  22 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org>  gconf-1.1.10.ebuild :
  popping in the gnome2 branch
  
*gconf-1.0.8-r3 (24 Apr 2002)

  24 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gconf-1.0.8-r3.ebuild :

  Updated DEPEND and RDEPEND info to be more accurate.
  

  13 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> : gconf-1.0.8-r2.ebuild

  Fix pkg_postinst() to create /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory, as the directory
  is empty, and gets removed on unmerge of older revisions.  The chmod then
  fails, causing the build to fail.

*gconf-1.0.8-r2 (17 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> :
  dev-util/indent is needed for a successful compilation, so it has been
  added to DEPEND flags. Reported by arpen@home.se 

*gconf-1.0.8-r1 (22 Feb 2002)

  22 Feb 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: fixed perms on
  /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory; this closes bug #803.  Added a pkg_postinst()
  fix so that upgraders can benefit from this fix as well.

*gconf-1.0.8 (13 Feb 2002)

  13 Feb 2002; G. Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>: Removed gnome-libs dependency
  (not needed).

*gconf-1.0.7-r2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
