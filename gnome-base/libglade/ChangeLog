*libglade-0.17-r4 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libglade-0.17-r4.ebuild :

  OK, I tried to be clever and separate out gnome support from a library that
  actually comes from GNOME.  Therefore, if gnome-libs is installed now, 
  gnome support will happen automatically.

*libglade-0.17-r4 (29 Mar 2002)

  29 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libglade-0.17-r4.ebuild :

  gnome is now an optional dependency, and USE dependent bonobo support
  is now compilable, because the libglade dependency in gnome-print has been
  sorted out.  This means the end of circular dependencies, hopefully.

*libglade-0.17-r3 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
