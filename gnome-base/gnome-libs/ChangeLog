  06 Jan 2004; <agriffis@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  stable on ia64

  12 Nov 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  Repair compilation with gcc-3.3.2 on alpha

  17 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  ok, so it took me a sec to realize : was equivalent to || in C there was deps
  on db < 2 on other arches, just not for amd64. make it all arches now

  17 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  seems to require db1 on amd64. surprised it doesn't on other systems, or
  perhaps it's installed by default on other systems and has just never been
  noticed as db1 on amd64 was just unmasked. Also remove patch that removed
  db-detecting as this messed things up on amd64, even though it was marked as
  an amd64-only patch.

  19 Jul 2003; Olivier Crete <tester@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild,
  files/no-libdb-check.diff:
  Added patch to removed libdb check, it was broken for db4

  08 Jul 2003; Alastair Tse <liquidx@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.1.6.ebuild,
  gnome-libs-1.4.1.7.ebuild, gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  swap DEPEND and RDEPEND

*gnome-libs-1.4.2 (19 Aug 2002)

  08 Jul 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild:
  added missing RDEPEND information that was messing up .tbz2 installs.

  04 Jul 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild :
  Added hppa to KEYWORDS.

  06 Dec 2002; Martin Holzer <mholzer@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild :
  Changes SRC_URI.
  
  23 Oct 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gnome-libs-1.4.2.ebuild :
  removed the "use doc" install hack (it gets installed anyhow) and change 
  docdir to include ${P}, this makes it do the documentation not to 
  /usr/share/doc/ .

  Added docbook-sgml as a compile-time dependency, until we figure out how to
  disable sgml documentation from being created (as an option or something).
