  made the GENTOO_MIRROR variable replacement a bit more robust;

  GENTOO_MIRROR variable and automatically checking those

  30 jan 2003; Mark Guertin <gerk@gentoo.org> mirrorselect-0.1.ebuild :
  Initial release, quick and ditry little dialog based script to pick
  your distfile mirror.  For now mirrors are hardcoded into script, but
  this will move of to something more dynamic when possible
