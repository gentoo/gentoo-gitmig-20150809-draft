*gentoolkit-0.1.16 (28 Jul 2002)

  06 Aug 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> gentoolkit-0.1.16.ebuild files/digest-gentoolkit-0.1.16:

  The utility useflag has been removed, as it is, in its current 
  implementation, very _DANGEROUS_ (in some common cases, it empties your 
  /etc/make.conf). If you still want to use it, don't 
  upgrade beyound 0.1.15-r2. See #5777 for details.
  
  Old version kept for backwards compatibility.

  Added dependency on grep-2.5-r1 or newer, as old systems may actually not
  have 2.5 installed.

*gentoolkit-0.1.11-r1 (08 Jun 2002)

  08 Jun 2002: Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> files/scripts/qpkg

  More qpkg updates, -v and -vv are much more useful, -U works with 
  the massive number of packages now in portage, which means that 
  qpkg now actually does what it's help says it will.

  Update qpkg.1 manpage with all the new qpkg workingness.

*gentoolkit-0.1.11 (04 Jun 2002)

  04 Jun 2002: Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> files/scripts/qpkg

  Fixed better, now -c does check for mis-cased md5s, and our time is
  a nice compromise between everything.  To accomplish this, I used tr
  instead of awk to do the case change, and only check IF the first md5
  check fails.

  04 Jun 2002: Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> gentoolkit-0.1.11.ebuild
						  files/scripts/qpkg
  Made qpkg root:wheel 0750 users really shouldn't have more than emerge -s
  permissions with this kind of stuff.

  qpkg changes: package	names print without stupid " *" at the end if -nc
		switch is given for easy piping to other programs (ie
		emerge)

		increased comment verbosity in preparation for more
		changes next time...

		--dups orders packages by COUNTER so that the old
			version is always above the new version, and
			also keeps packages of same base name together,
			and is now colorized (disable with -nc)

		-c no longer awks md5s because it takes too long (5
			times as long as w/o awking) this will report
			broken files on systems installed with whatever
			it was that was touppering all all md5s.

*gentoolkit-0.1.10-r1 (04 Jun 2002)

*gentoolkit-0.1.1 (2 Feb 2002)

  2 Feb 2002; Leo Lipelis <aeoo@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Jochem Kossen has added a nice diff/sdiff mode to etc-update.  As many
  people do not prefer vim, etc-update will now default to using diff for
  displaying changes and sdiff for merging changes!  This means, if you use
  any editor other than vim, the script will now work for you out of the box.
  But, vim users need not panic!  Vim diff functionality is still there in the
  script.  Just read the top of the etc-update file and configure it
  appropriately.  To sum up: vim users keep getting what they've been getting,
  and everyone else gets cool diff/sdiff mode.

*gentoolkit-0.1.0 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
