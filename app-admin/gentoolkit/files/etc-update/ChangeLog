	* etc-update is now configured through a configuration file (default
	  /etc/etc-updaterc)
	* added a default helpmessage for sdiff so users might understand how to
	  use it
	* changed one menu option from the merge menu (menu2) from "Restart
	  etc-update" to "Back to previous menu" since that's more correct
	* added this CHANGES file
