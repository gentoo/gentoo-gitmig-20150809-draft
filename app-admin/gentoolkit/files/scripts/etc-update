# EXPLANATION
#
# pager:
#
# Examples of pager usage:
#	pager=""		# don't use a pager
#	pager="less -E"	# less
#	pager="more"	# more
#
#
# diff_command:
#
# Arguments:
#	%file1	[REQUIRED]
#	%file2	[REQUIRED]
#
# Examples of diff_command:
#	diff_command="diff -uN %file1 %file2"	# diff
#	diff_command="vim -d %file1 %file2"		# vimdiff
#
#
# merge_command:
#
# Arguments:
#	%orig	[REQUIRED]
#   %new    [REQUIRED]
#	%merged	[REQUIRED]
#
# Examples of merge_command:
#	merge_command="sdiff -s -o %merged %old %new"	# sdiff
#

# NOTE_1: Editors such as vim/vimdiff are not usable for the merge_command
# because it is not known what filenames the produced files have (the user can
# choose while using those programs)

# NOTE_2: Make sure pager is set to "" when using an editor as diff_command!
