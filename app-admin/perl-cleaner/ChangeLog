*perl-cleaner-1.03 (20 Feb 2006)

  20 Feb 2006; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  +perl-cleaner-1.03.ebuild:
  New version - better support for multilibs and virtuals

  03 Jul 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  perl-cleaner-1.01.ebuild:
  RDPEND -> RDEPEND - thanks jakub

*perl-cleaner-1.01 (05 Jun 2005)

  05 Jun 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org>
  -perl-cleaner-1.0.ebuild, +perl-cleaner-1.01.ebuild:
  Sad to have a version bump already, but the is a code addition to be able to
  re-emerge everything, even those modules installed under our current version
  of perl. Comes up if someone (ick) changes from a threaded perl to a
  non-threaded perl - version doesn't change so perl-cleaner doesn't rebuild
  anything (though it needs to)

*perl-cleaner-1.0 (05 Jun 2005)

  05 Jun 2005; Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +perl-cleaner-1.0.ebuild:
  Initial import, prepping so perl-cleaner can be called from revdep-rebuilder
