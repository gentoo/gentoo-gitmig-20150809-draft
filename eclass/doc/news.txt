fix for emerging a new kdelibs

23/12
v5
This adds full support for multi-version coexistence, e.g. kde/qt 2/3/...
There have been many many changes. Some of the are:

A good conformist inheriting ebuild shuold now look something like this:
------------
# 4 header lines
. /usr/portage/eclass/inherit.eclass || die
inherit kde-something || die	# inherit kde-base for most ebuilds, kde-dst/kde-i18n etc. for others
need-kde x.y.z	# must be present!

# any code after this is not required and extends/overrides only
need-qt x.y.z
myconf="$myconf --mysetting=yes"
<change other variables, functions>
------------

depend.eclass has been merged into kde.eclass due to cross-dependencies between the two.

Note: need-kdelibs() is now called need-kde().

need-kdelibs() exports:
KDEVER			version number required/matching
KDEMAJORVER		major version component (2, 3...)
KDEVER[]			array with components of KDEVER as elements (output of separate-string())
					major is element 0, minor is element 1... alpha, beta, pre, rc are resolved to
					-4, -3, -2, -1. There are always 5 elements; any missing ones are set to 0.
					
If/when you want to do some kde2/3 specific stuff, just branch based on $KDEMAJORVER and/or $KDEVER, $KDEVER[].

need-kdelibs() also adds KDEVER to DEPEND/RDEPEND and calls set-kdedir() which hasn't changed since v4.9.
need-kdelibs() also calls qtver-from-kdever(), a new function that matches a qt version number to the supplied
kde version number. Then need-kdelibs() calls need-qt() with the version number supplied by qtver-from-kdever().

If you need a non-standard qt version, you can call need-q(0 yourself (after calling need-kde()) to override.
need-qt() works exactly the same as need-kdelibs().

Again: you must call need-kde, and you must supply *some* version.

All inheriting ebuilds have been updated to use the new scheme.

Only ebuilds inheriting from kde-base or directly from kde need to call need-kde(); the kde-dist, kde-i18n
and koffice-i18n eclasses do it for you.

23/12
v4.9
This extends depend.eclass a lot, adds function select-version(). I will now work on eclasses
that will support qt/kde 2/3/... equally well and that will be v5. I will also update and clarify
the docs then.
select-version() select the best version from a number of versions offered. In comparison
with the former simplistic algorithm, it supports:
- incompatible major versions (i.e. 2.2.1 resolves to 2.3.2 not 3.0.1)
- release type support (alpha, beta, pre, rc) and portage-format version specification:
$major.$minor.$revision_<type>$number.
- version parts > 9. The old algorithm compared per-character and thus thought 12<2.
There are many more misc small updates and changes.
One of them is that $DEBUG_OUTPUT is now changed into $ECLASS_DEBUG_OUTPUT, and can
be set before running emerge/ebuild. That is, you don't ahve to edit debug.eclass anymore.

16/11
v4
Added multi-qt and multi-kdelibs functionality. See detailed explanation in eclass howto.
There is now a new depend.eclass inherited by kde.eclass. It provides two pairs of
functions, need-{kdelibs,qt} and set-{kdedir,qtdir}.
An inheriting ebuild calls "need-kdelibs $ver" from its main section and gets the correct
things added to DEPEND and RDEPEND. Same for qt. Usually ebuilds don't call need-qt
directly, because the kdelibs depend already provides them with the necessary qt
version, but the function does exist and is usable.
The set-* functions are called at the beginning of kde_src_compile/configure section.
They export the correct QTDIR and KDEDIR (the latter points to the location of kdelibs)
based on the vars kde_version and qt_version which are set in need-*. (So don't touch
these vars; I've added a list of Internal Vars to the eclass howto). If no multi-*-scheme
compatible directories are found, set-* leaves KDEDIR/QTDIR untouched, this enables
older systems to work with the new eclass and ebuilds.
There have been many other misc small changes in the eclasses, because this was a
big commit after weeks of testing. For example the newdepend() function was added to
base.eclass; I'll eventually modify ebuilds to use it.
When the new dep functionality is added to portage, I'll change the need-* functions
accordingly, but the ebuilds won't need to be changed.

26/10
Added koffice-i18n.eclass, very similar to kde-i18n.eclass.

15/10
Added some multi-QTDIR failsafes (shouldn't be needed, but do no harm):
myconf+=--with-qt-dir=${QTDIR}
LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRARY_PATH}:${QTDIR}/lib make

~12/10
kde-objprelink-patch fixes

5/10
v3.3
Removal of kde-objprelink. You now inherit from it no longer :-)
It has been merged into kde. You will get the dependency and the configure parameter
automatically, and can call kde-objprelink-patch() (which is now in kde.eclass) if needed.

3/10
v3.2
Addition of kde-objprelink, further minor changes and fixes.
You now inherit from kde-objprelink. If you need the admin patch, run kde-objprelink-patch()
at the end of src_unpack. kde-dist inherits from kde-objprelink, other eclasses do not.

2/10
Unmasking of eclasses. Other developers test, but do not use in their work. Evaluation period.

1/10
v3.1
Addition of debug.eclass.

1/10
v3
Another major change.
This involves primarily the kde eclasses.

We now have kde.eclass, which is *not* the same as kde.eclass from v2, but is
rather a kde-virtual eclass. It includes all the basic definitions and standard
functions. It is med-level; people do not usually inherit from it.

Then, we have high-level eclasses:
kde-base.eclass inherits c,kde and adds pbjprelink,qt deps. It's used by misc apps.
kde.org.eclass adds the SRC_URI/SRC_PATH block for ftp.kde.org and friends.
kde-dist.eclass inherits kde-base,kde.org and adds HOMEPAGE,DESCRIPTION etc. and
	Kkdelibs-${PV} deps. It is used by kdebase/* packages.
kde-i18n.eclass inerits kde,kde.org and adds the neccessary things for kde-i18n packages.
	It will probably be used for the upcoming koffice-i18n packages as well.

Notice, now you now longer call kde-base_ and kde-i18n_ functions, but only kde_ functions.

I have had to swap eclasses' names around to make them more intuitive. Here is a table
of the changes:
kde-virtual	=>	kde
kde			=>	kde-base
kde-base	=>	kde-dist + kde.org
kde-i18n	==	kde-i18n

(kde-virtual was a mid-stage eclass from version 2.5 which was never commited on cvs).

1/10
v2.5
A temp version which wasn't commited. Testbed for radical ideas.

30/9
v2
Documented in original howto

29/9
v1
Original version
Had an infinite recursion in base.eclass. Was deleted from cvs later that day.
