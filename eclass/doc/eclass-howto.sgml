   Introduction
  </title>
  <para>
   eclasses are parts of ebuilds; that is, they have the same syntax ebuilds do, but do not define all the required variables and functions. ebuilds can inherit from eclasses, and eclasses can inherit from other eclasses. As in OOP, this is used to ensure maximum code reuse among similar ebuilds.
  </para>
  <para>
   The most similar group of ebuilds is the kde apps. These have been selected to be the test case for the first incarnation of eclasses. Inheriting ebuilds are available for all of kde-2.2.1 (as kde*-2.2.1-r1), kdevelop-2.0.1 and koffice-1.1. Others will follow.
  </para>
  <para>
   Please read news.txt for an abstract of changes between versions of the eclasses.

   Section two explains how eclasses work; section three explains how to write inheriting ebuilds.

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    ebuild variables/functions</emphasis> refers to those used in std. ebuilds e.g. &dollar;S, &dollar;P, src_unpack()...

    Versioning: I suppose I could have made, instead of versions 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.1 versions 0.1, ... 0.3.1, or maybe 0.0.3-1. Usually I would. Not sure why I didn't. Too late to change it now.

   <title>
   The eclasses
  </title>
  <para>
   The best way of becoming familiar with the current eclass structure is an explanation of what each eclass does.
  </para>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    inherit.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Defines inherit() function which handles sourcing of eclasses.
   </para>
   <para>
    Syntax of inheriting: we define a simple function inherit():
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [ECLASSDIR=/usr/portage/eclass
]]><![ CDATA [inherit() {
]]><![ CDATA [    while [ "$1" ]; do
]]><![ CDATA [        source ${ECLASSDIR}/${1}.eclass
]]><![ CDATA [    shift
]]><![ CDATA [    done
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    This function simply sources files from a hard-coded location. If, in the future, we will decide to move eclasses to a different location or to introduce more &ldquo;formats&rdquo; (like drobbins' projected <emphasis>xbuilds</emphasis>), any name-to-file resolution code will go in here.
   </para>
   <para>
    Every inheriting ebuild begins with these two lines:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [. /usr/portage/eclass/inherit.eclass || die
]]><![ CDATA [inherit <list of eclasses> || die
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    Eclasses do not need this first line, since they are always sourced from an ebuild which has it.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    virtual.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Defines empty variables and functions; defines EXPORT_FUNCTIONS(). Also inherits debug.eclass so that everyone gets that.
   </para>
   <para>
    This eclass is inherited by most other eclasses e.g. base, kde*. As a rule, any eclass that defines some of the base functions needs it. Therefore the only ebuilds which don't get it are the ones that only inherit one of the smaller eclasses e.g. c, autoconf.
   </para>
   <para>
    It defines all ebuild vars and funcs to be empty.
   </para>
   <para>
    It also defines the EXPORT_FUNCTIONS() function which looks like this:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [EXPORT_FUNCTIONS() {
]]><![ CDATA [    while [ "$1" ]; do
]]><![ CDATA [        eval "$1() { ${ECLASS}_$1 ; }" > /dev/null
]]><![ CDATA [    shift
]]><![ CDATA [    done
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    This means that after foo.eclass has defined e.g. src_unpack() and src_install(), it says:
   </para>
   <para>
    ECLASS=foo
   </para>
   <para>
    EXPORT_FUNCTIONS src_unpack src_install
   </para>
   <para>
    Actually, the ECLASS setting is put at the beginning of the eclass, directly after the inherit statements. It will in the future be used by other functions as well. Someday we will (I hope) adapt the portage ebuild filename-&gt;name algorithm and get the ECLASS setting the same way we do &dollar;P and &dollar;PN.
   </para>
   <para>
    EXPORT_FUNCTIONS() creates stub functions called &dollar;&lcub;ECLASS&rcub;_blah for every parameter blah passed to it. The stub function does nothing but call blah.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you inherit more than one eclass (almost always), your ebuild functions are those defined by the 1st eclass inherited. Since eclasses usually inherit other eclasses, you do not want to keep track of that. Instead, you prefix all your functions from foo.eclass with foo_, or &dollar;&lcub;ECLASS&rcub;_. This way, people can call a specific function from a specific eclass and know what they are going to get.
   </para>
   <para>
    Because you still want default functions to be defined with the original ebuild names, you call EXPORT_FUNCTIONS() at the end of every eclass. This makes sure that the default functions you passed as parameters are stubs calling the ones you just defined.
   </para>
   <para>
    I looked at adding &dollar;&lcub;EBUILD&rcub;_ instead of literal strings to the actual function definitions, but the bash syntax for that is too ugly.
   </para>
    <sect3>
     <title>
     ebuild function sections
    </title>
    <para>
     Although this is not an integral part of eclasses, this is a good place to introduce function sections. 
    </para>
    <para>
     One rarely uses predefined functions as-is; you usually want to extend them. Once they have unique names (foo_src_unpack) it's easy to add code that executes before or after them. Function sections break them down and allow code to execute between any two sections.
    </para>
    <para>
     The implementation is simple. Let's take as an example the src_compile() function from base.eclass. It looks like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [base_src_compile() {
]]><![ CDATA [./configure || die
]]><![ CDATA [make || die
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>    </programlisting>
    <para>
     Here is the same function, divided into sections:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [base_src_compile() {
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [    [ -z "$1" ] && base_src_compile all
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [    while [ "$1" ]; do
]]><![ CDATA [
]]><![ CDATA [        case $1 in
]]><![ CDATA [            configure)
]]><![ CDATA [                ./configure || die;;
]]><![ CDATA [            make)
]]><![ CDATA [                make || die;;
]]><![ CDATA [            all)
]]><![ CDATA [                base_src_compile configure make;;
]]><![ CDATA [        esac
]]><![ CDATA [
]]><![ CDATA [    shift
]]><![ CDATA [    done
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>    </programlisting>
    <para>
     The code has been divided into two &ldquo;sections&rdquo;: <emphasis>configure</emphasis> and <emphasis>make</emphasis>. In our simple example, they correspond to the two commands in the original function.
    </para>
    <para>
     In the center of the new function is a while;case...esac;shift;done block. This block matches the parameters to the functions with the defined section names and executes the corresponding lines of code.
    </para>
    <para>
     The special case <emphasis>all</emphasis> calls the same function recursively with a list of sections in order. It's up to the eclass's author to maintain this list, which is very important.
    </para>
    <para>
     The line before the block says that a call without parameters should be treated the same as a call with the single parameter <emphasis>all. </emphasis>As you see, this function recurses a lot. Note, however, that the call <emphasis>base_src_compile configure all make </emphasis>is also legal; it will execute <emphasis>base_src_compile configure configure make make</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Now, in your ebuild (or eclass) that inherits from base.eclass, you get the stub function src_compile which calls base_src_compile without parameters. This makes base_src_compile execute <emphasis>all</emphasis>, that is, all its sections. You can leave it as-is. If you wish to extend it, you define a new src_compile and call base_src_compile a section at a time:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [src_compile() {
]]><![ CDATA [    myfunc1
]]><![ CDATA [    base_src_compile configure
]]><![ CDATA [    myfunc2
]]><![ CDATA [    base_src_compile make
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>    </programlisting>
    <para>
     The only way to know what functions contain what sections is to read the eclasses.
    </para>
    <para>
     A final note: not all functions execute all their sections when called with <emphasis>all</emphasis> or without parameters. Some sections may be non-standard and must be called explicitly. Current examples include base_src_unpack<emphasis> patch.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     A more final note: the eclasses also include some debug statements, which are not part of the function/section structure. More on this at the debug.eclass section.
    </para>
    </sect3>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    base.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    This eclass defines some default variables and functions, similar to those you'd get by default in a non-inheriting ebuild.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is inherited by higher-level eclasses like the kde ones.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that in base_src_unpack there is one non-default section (i.e. it doesn't execute for section <emphasis>all</emphasis>). It is called <emphasis>patch</emphasis> and it looks like this:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [cd ${S}
]]><![ CDATA [patch -p0 < ${FILESDIR}/${P}-gentoo.diff
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    Once, long ago, I remember hearing that emerge would execute this code automatically between src_unpack() and src_compile() if the file &dollar;&lcub;FILESDIR&rcub;/&dollar;&lcub;P&rcub;-gentoo.diff was present. Was this a plan, a rumour, or what? Someone please correct me, or at least correct this document.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    kde.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Used by all kde apps, whether directly or indirectly. This is a med-level eclass, which is intended to provide not only sensible defaults but functions which can be used as-is more often then not. In fact, none of the high-level kde-* eclasses which inherit from here change the functions in any way, and the ebuilds rarely do so.
   </para>
   <para>
    It inherits autoconf and base.
   </para>
   <para>
    Read it to find out what it defines. It is quite self-explanatory.
   </para>
   <para>
    Briefly, it handles all standard kde-2.1* and 2.2* apps that need configure/make/make install cycles. It handles all the std. configure options e.g. qtmt. It also adds kdelibs to DEPEND/RDEPEND.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note: some kde apps, like widget styles and i18n packages, do not need to compile anything. Therefore kde.eclass does not inherit c and does not depend on qt. These packages can then inherit straight from here (or from kde-i18n.eclass, which also inherits from here). All other packages, which need to compile c code and link against qt, should inherit from kde-base.eclass.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    kde-base.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Meant for standard kde apps, of both 2.1 and 2.2 architectures. Inherits c,kde and adds qt deps. Sets HOMEPAGE=apps.kde.com.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    kde-i18n.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Meant for the kde-i18n-* packages, possibly also for the koffice-i18n to-be-written packages. Niche use.
   </para>
   <para>
    In fact, all kde-i18n ebuilds are completely identical and so all they have to do is inherit from this eclass.
   </para>
   <para>
    Inherits from kde,kde.org. Makes a few differences, such as PROVIDE virtual/kde-i18n, correct &dollar;S, HOMEPAGE and DESCRIPTION.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    kde-dist.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Meant for the base kde distribution packages in kde-base/*. Inherits kde-base, kde.org and kde-objprelink. Adds the correct DESCRIPTION and HOMEPAGE and kdelibs-&dollar;&lcub;PV&rcub; deps. The simpler/smaller kde-base/ packages (e.g. kdetoys) make no changes at all; most of those that do only add deps.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    c.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Adds gcc and glibc to DEPEND and RDEPEND.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    autoconf.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Adds make/automake/autoconf to DEPEND.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    debug.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Adds verbose output debugging functions. Is inherited by virtual.eclass.
   </para>
   <para>
    A function with debugging looks like this:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [base_src_install() {
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [        debug-print-function base_src_install $*
]]><![ CDATA [        [ -z "$1" ] && base_src_install all
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [        while [ "$1" ]; do
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [        case $1 in
]]><![ CDATA [                make)
]]><![ CDATA [                        debug-print-section make
]]><![ CDATA [                        make DESTDIR=${D} install || die
]]><![ CDATA [                        ;;
]]><![ CDATA [            all)
]]><![ CDATA [                        debug-prnit-section all
]]><![ CDATA [                        base_src_install make
]]><![ CDATA [                        ;;
]]><![ CDATA [        esac
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [        shift
]]><![ CDATA [        done
]]><![ CDATA [ 
]]><![ CDATA [}
]]>   </programlisting>
   <para>
    debug-print-function() prints &ldquo;now in function &dollar;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;parameters are &dollar;2...&rdquo; (all following parameters to the function).
   </para>
   <para>
    debug-print-section() prints &ldquo;now in section &dollar;1&rdquo;.
   </para>
   <para>
    debug-print() prints raw &ldquo;&dollar;1&rdquo;.
   </para>
   <para>
    Inside debug.eclass are several settings, which can later be moved to some external config file. They include turning debug on or off and redirecting its output.
   </para>
   <para>
    The functions are used in all ebuild functions/sections of all eclasses, and in the helper functions inherit() and EXPORT_FUNCTIONS().
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that all debugging output is off by default. You can change this setting in debug.eclass (for now), but be careful not to commit the new setting to cvs. In addition, debug output is further disabled in inherit() in inherit.eclass to avoid extra-inheriting. You can enable it there by uncommenting the appropriate lines.
   </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
    <title>
    kde-objprelink.eclass
   </title>
   <para>
    Provides objprelink deps (&gt;=objprelink-0-r1). Also provides a function kde-objprelink-patch() that applies the kde-admin-acinclude patch. Call it and the end of your src_unpack if you need it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Known issue: the actual --enable-objprelink option is passed to configure from kde.eclass, regardless of the inheritance of objprelink. Therefore if:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    A package has builtin objprelink capability which can be activated from configure with --enable-objprelink
    </para>
   </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    The package does not inherit from kde-objprelink (or kde-dist etc.)
    </para>
   </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    USE objprelink is set
    </para>
   </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    &gt;=objprelink-0-r1 is, incidentally, not installed
    </para>
   </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <para>
    Then, the make process will try to use objprelink, but won't find it and will (may?) fail and abort.
   </para>
   <para>
    However, because the package will depend on kdelibs, which inherits kde-objprelink through kde-dist, the chances of this happening are practically nil. In any case, I'll try to think of a better solution.
   </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
   <title>
   The inheriting ebuilds
  </title>
  <para>
   Not much here as yet. Look at the kde*-2.2.1-r1 ebuilds for examples. As a rule, read the eclass you are inheriting from and put any necessary changes in your ebuild. For now, a collection of tips:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
   <para>
   Always extend variables and functions. You should almost never need to replace them. In particular, always remember to use DEPEND=&rdquo;&dollar;DEPEND...&rdquo; and the same for RDEPEND.
   </para>
  </listitem>
   <listitem>
   <para>
   The eclasses have DESCRIPTION=&rdquo;Derived from &dollar;ECLASS&rdquo; set. This is to remind you to write a description of your own for your ebuilds. Otherwise the inherited one will show through as a reminder.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
