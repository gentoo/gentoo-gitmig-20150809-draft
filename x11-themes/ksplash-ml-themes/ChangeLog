*ksplash-ml-themes-20020705-r1 (01 Oct 2002)

  01 Oct 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Fix bug #6519 (ksplash-ml now being actually used as the kde
  splashscreen). See the bugzilla page for full info. Briefly, you can set
  $KSPLASH in your profile to the full path of a ksplash-replacement binary
  of your choice. By default, ksplash-ml is used if installed (actually it
  sets $KSPLASH in env.d), otherwise the default kde ksplash. You will need
  the latest revision of ksplash-ml and ksplash-ml-themes as well. All this
  is masked for now.
