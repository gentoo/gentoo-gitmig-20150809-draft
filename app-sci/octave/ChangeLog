  02 Feb 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> octave-2.1.40.ebuild, octave-2.1.36-r1.ebuild :

  fixed tetex optional dependency typo. Thanks to Daniel Karlsson <d.k@home.se> (#14685) for reporting this.

*octave-2.1.40 (13 Dec 2002)
  
  13 Dec 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> octave-2.1.40.ebuild, files/digest-octave-2.1.40 : 
  new version

*octave-2.0.17-r1 (13 Jul 2002)

  25 Oct 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> octave-2.0.17-r1.ebuild, files/digest-octave-2.0.17-r1 :
  fix for sandbox violation

*octave-2.1.36-r1 (01 Oct 02)

  01 Oct 2002; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Closing bug 8486 by ripping out all references to dvips.  DVIPS generates
  fonts on the fly, which causes massive sandbox failures.  Instead, we leave
  docs in DVI format if USE=tetex, which are then installed uncompressed into
  /usr/share/doc/octave-2.1.36-r1 .

*octave-2.1.36 (15 Jul 2002)

  19 Sep 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :
  Added PPC to KEYWORDS.

  15 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> 
  octave-2.1.36.ebuild, files/digest-octave-2.1.36, files/filebuf.diff :
  Updated to latest "unstable" version.  Included a patch to compile
  properly with gcc-3.x.  After fixing the problem I found RedHat's
  patch posted to the bug report.  And theirs was cleaner than mine.
  Closes bug #4933

*octave-2.0.17 (13 Jul 2002)

  03 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> octave-2.0.17.ebuild :
  Changed to econf.  Changed from emake to make to alleviate build
  problems.

  13 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> octave-2.0.17.ebuild :
  Updated to latest stable version.  The "unstable" version is on it's way.

*octave-2.0.16 (19 Feb 2002)

  19 Feb 2002; T.Neidt <tod@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, octave-2.0.16.ebuild :
  Initial commit. GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended
  for numerical computations. It is mostly compatible with Matlab.
