*gromacs-3.1.4-r1 (23 Mar 2003)

  23 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gromacs-3.1.4-r1.ebuild :
  added mpi support, lam-mpi is the only working implementation at the moment.
  !IMPORTANT!:
  Since portage cannot at present check whether optional dependencies of dependencies were turned on, 
  please check yourself that gromacs and fftw have identical mpi setting.
  Generally USE="mpi" emerge gromacs should work fine if you did not install fftw previously (with 
  different mpi off for example).

*gromacs-3.1.4 (08 Nov 2002)

  08 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> gromacs-3.1.4.ebuild, files/digest-gromacs-3.1.4 :

  new version.
  !!!IMPORTANT!!!
  I changed --prefix to point to /usr for FHS compliance.
  Now the binaries and the libs are getting installed into
  /usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/{bin,lib} correspondingly and the data into /usr/share/gromacs-${PV}
  This seems to fit well in the existing direcory structure and does not conflict with gcc.

*gromacs-3.1.3 (27 Apr 2002)
  
  27 Apr 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> all_files :

  initial release.
