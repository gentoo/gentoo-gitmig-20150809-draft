		SeaView is a graphical multiple sequence alignment editor developped by
		Manolo Gouy. SeaView is able to read and write various alignment
		formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE). It allows to
		manually edit the alignment, and also to run DOT-PLOT or CLUSTALW
		programs to locally improve the alignment.
