*oregano-0.23-r1 (22 Sep 2002) 

  22 Sep 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> oregano-0.23-r1.ebuild:
  Overhaul of oregeno ebuild.  Please note the upstream version is
  no longer supported and its author encourages users to move to other
  programs. 

*oregano-0.23 (13 Jun 2002)

  13 Jun 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> oregano-0.23.ebuild:
  Initial ebuild, this seems like a very nice schematic editing program
  I was working a lab report this morning, tried to emerge xcircuit, but
  got SegFaults so I decided to find something else.  Then I made an
  ebuild for it.
