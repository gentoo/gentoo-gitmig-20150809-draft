		Blueproxy is a simple proxy server to convert Bluetooth RFCOMM
		connections into TCP connections. This frees Bluetooth application
		programmers from having to worry about getting Bluetooth bindings for
		their language of choice. Notable features include sending preambles
		to allow a single TCP server to aggregrate multiple Bluetooth sensors,
		and a scanning mode to continuously detect Bluetooth devices entering
		into range of a sensor.
