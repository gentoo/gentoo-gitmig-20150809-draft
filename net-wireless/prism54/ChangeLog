*prism54-20040208 (08 Feb 2004)

  08 Feb 2004; Peter Johanson <latexer@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  prism54-20040208.ebuild:
  Initial commit. Thanks to all in bug #40574 for the help. For now, not
  mirroring the firmware image until we know if we can. As usual, disable
  sandbox to emerge with 2.6 kernels until bug #32737 is resolved.
