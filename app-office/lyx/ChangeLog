  07 Apr 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> lyx-1.3.1.ebuild:
  Fetch the .tar.bz2 not the .tar.gz, as it is considerably smaller. Closes
  #17853 - thanks to John Steele Scott for noticing.

  06 Apr 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> lyx-1.3.1.ebuild:
  Add stable x86 keyword.

  Add ~alpha to KEYWORDS

  Add ~alpha to KEYWORDS

  05 Mar 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> lyx-1.3.0.ebuild:
  Fix bug #15692 - a compile problem, especially with gcc 2.x, where the
  default compile flags weren't being added, which made the compile fail.

  12 Feb 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :
  A new major version. Among many other nice things this adds a qt3 interface,
  which is used instead of the xforms one if 'qt' USE flag is on. The qt
  interface provides antialiasing and suhc stuff, as well as qt3's unicode
  input management support (so you don't need to deal with lyx-style keymap
  files).

  13 Jan 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Mark lyx 1.2.3 as stable on x86.

*lyx-1.2.3 (10 Jan 2003)

  10 Jan 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  man pages in LFH correct locations.

  11 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> lyx-1.2.1.ebuild :

  Changed spell dependency to aspell from ispell, from a request by
  tester@videotron.ca (Olivier Crete) in bug #7557

  04 Sep 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Fix bugs like #7323: make the dep on xforms =xforms-1*, so that the old
  and broken xforms-089 package doesn't satisfy it anymore.

  02 Sep 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> lyx-1.2.1.ebuild ChangeLog :

  05 Jul 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  This is a 20020705 snapshot of the lyx cvs 1.2.x branch - i.e. 1.2.0 plus
  all the bugfixes made
  so far, working towards a 1.2.1 release. It fixes fex. #3538.

  7 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  Add app-text/chktex dep since that ebuild now works.

*lyx-1.2.0 (1 Jun 2002)

  1 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> changelog:
  
  The great new release of lyx (see changelog).
  The lyx=lyx-base+lyx-utils scheme has been abandoned; the app-office/lyx-base
  and app-office/lyx-utils ebuilds have been deprecated. I think they are
  unnecessary. From now on, app-office/lyx will both install lyx itslf and 
  depend on all the lyx utils.

*lyx-1.1.6.4 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
