*koffice-1.2_beta1-r1 (27 April 2002)

  27 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Seemed i was still pointing to the kde-packagers URL..
  And the real URL seems to have all patches included already..
  This revision also fixes the docbook errors most of you were having.
  And i changed the description of the ebuild :o)

*koffice-1.2_beta1 (26 April 2002)

  26 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  First beta released! Since i'm a kde packager now, much more
  post-beta1 bugs have been patched, and the package is much more tested
  than the other previous koffice releases.. Enjoy! 

*koffice-1.2_pre20020402 (2 April 2002)

  2 April 2002; Bart Verwilst <verwilst@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  This Koffice works with KDE/QT 3. It's MUCH better than the 1.x 
  releases, and IMHO is the first version that's useable for real work,
  like writing my thesis. Because there isn't an official version out just 
  yet, this snapshot will be our official koffice version for Gentoo..
  If you have any problems, just bugreport them to bugs.kde.org, and if 
  it's a grave bug, and it's fixed in a more current snapshot, tell me, 
  and i'll consider upgrading this gentoo-snapshot to the one with the 
  bugfixes. Enjoy!  

*koffice-1.1.1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
