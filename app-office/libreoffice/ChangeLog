*libreoffice-3.3.0_rc4 (24 Jan 2011)

  24 Jan 2011; Andreas Proschofsky <suka@gentoo.org>
  +libreoffice-3.3.0_rc4.ebuild, +files/gentoo-3.3.0_rc4.diff,
  +files/enable-startup-notification.diff, +files/env_log.diff,
  +files/fix-ooo-collision.diff, +files/gentoo-pythonpath.diff,
  +files/scrap-pixmap-links.diff, +metadata.xml:
  Initial ebuild for LibreOffice, masked for now as it needs some testing.
  Also:

  * Extensions are not built atm, otherwise this breaks the build
  * ebuild needs some cleanups

  Thanks especially to Hanno Meyer-Thurow (geki) which did a lot of the ground
  work in his overlay!
