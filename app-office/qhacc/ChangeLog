  03 Jan 2004; Caleb Tennis <caleb@gentoo.org> qhacc-2.9.ebuild:
  Put the qt dependency directly in the ebuild, remove the need kde as I don't
  believe it's needed anymore.

  16 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> qhacc-2.9.ebuild,
  files/qhacc-2.9-gentoo.patch, files/qhacc-2.9-mysqlplugin-gcc-3.3.patch:
  Now, qhacc actually compiles! Additionally, install locations are fixed,
  symlinks are fixed, mysql plugin compiles now. Basically, this is what the
  ebuild should have been. Thanks to Brandy Westcott <brandy@gentoo.org> for
  finding and fixing this.
