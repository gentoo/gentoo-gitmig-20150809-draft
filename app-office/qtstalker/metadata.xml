          Qtstalker is a basic end of day Technical Analysis package with many
          features. It compares with similar commercial products like Metastock,
          Superchartz, Tradestation (...maybe one day) etc. If you are familiar
          with those, then you should be able to muddle along with Qtstalker.

          The project has kept to a lean and simple design philosophy in order
          to maximize speed, portability and resource usage.
