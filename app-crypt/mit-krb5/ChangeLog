*mit-krb5-1.2.7 (30 Mar 2003)

  20 Apr 2003; Joshua Brindle <method@gentoo.org> mit-krb5-1.2.6-r2.ebuild,
  mit-krb5-1.2.6-r3.ebuild, mit-krb5-1.2.7.ebuild:
  added --with-ccopts= so it won't disregard user CFLAGS

  30 Mar 2003; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> mit-krb5-1.2.7.ebuid :
  Security update. Various patches from MIT applied.  

*mit-krb5-1.2.6-r2 (07 Dec 2002)

  30 Dec 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> mit-krb5-1.2.6-r3 :
  Added Martti Rannajarvi's fixes. Fixes #3480

  07 Dec 2002; Dave Love <dlove@cashmeresoftware.com>, 
  Martti Rannanjärvi <grypt@kapsi.net>:
  
  Optional kerberos4 support by krb4 USE flag, default configuration
  files and an init.d script. --localstatedir to /etc.

*krb5-1.2.6-r1 (06 Dec 2002)

  06 Dec 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> krb5-1.2.6-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-krb5-1.2.6-r1 files/krb5-1.2.6-r1.diff

  Now provides virtual/krb5. Client utils are also installed now with
  a leading "k" to signify their kerberos use and not to overlap the
  standard tool. IE: /usr/bin/ftp is the standard ftp client, while
  /usr/bin/kftp is the kerbized client. This resolves bug #8669.

*krb5-1.2.6 (28 Oct 2002)

  28 Oct 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Security update.

*krb5-1.2.5-r2 (02 aug 2002)

  02 Aug 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> krb5-1.2.5-r2.ebuild :

  Security update, compile fix and updated homepage URL.

*krb5-1.2.5-r1 (22 Jun 2002)

  22 Jun 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> :

  Changed --localstatedir from /var/krb5kdc to /var because the /krb5kdc is
  automatically appended.

*krb5-1.2.3 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Updated to 1.2.3.

*krb5-1.2.2-r1 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Thanks to Michael Kaufman, we now have a working ebuild.  Previous ebuild
  failed to build klist, kvno, kpasswd, kinit, and kdestroy.  There was
  also a linker problem which has been fixed.
  
*krb5-1.2.2 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
