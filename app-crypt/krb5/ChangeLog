  21 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> krb5-1.2.7-r1.ebuild :
  Bumped revision, forcing rebuild so that people who already had it will
  not get problems later on when they upgrade glibc.

*krb5-1.2.7 (22 Feb 2003)

  17 Mar 2003; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> :

  06 Dec 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> krb5-1.2.6-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-krb5-1.2.6-r1 files/krb5-1.2.6-r1.diff
  Now provides virtual/krb5. Client utils are also installed now with
  a leading "k" to signify their kerberos use and not to overlap the
  standard tool. IE: /usr/bin/ftp is the standard ftp client, while
  /usr/bin/kftp is the kerbized client. This resolves bug #8669.

*krb5-1.2.6 (28 Oct 2002)

  28 Oct 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :
  Security update.

  Security update, compile fix and updated homepage URL.

  22 Jun 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> :

  Changed --localstatedir from /var/krb5kdc to /var because the /krb5kdc is
  automatically appended.

*krb5-1.2.3 (21 Feb 2002)

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Updated to 1.2.3.

  21 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Thanks to Michael Kaufman, we now have a working ebuild.  Previous ebuild
  failed to build klist, kvno, kpasswd, kinit, and kdestroy.  There was
  also a linker problem which has been fixed.

  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
