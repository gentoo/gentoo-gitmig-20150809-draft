  10 Jan 2003; Kain <kain@kain.org> : blender-2.26_pre20030109.ebuild
  files/digest-blender-2.26_pre20030109
  Blender CVS snapshot source build for 2.26.  I figured this would be decent
  to work with, since Blender CVS is in feature freeze at the moment.  This
  blender works with autoconf and has GCC-3 fixes, so it builds (and runs!)
  for me on PPC and x86.  Testers wanted.
