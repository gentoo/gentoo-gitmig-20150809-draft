  Added sparc to keywords.

  19 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.9.ebuild :

*graphviz-1.8.10-r3 (21 Jan 2003)

  19 Mar 2003; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r3.ebuild:
  Added ~sparc to keywords.

  13 Mar 2003; Olivier Reisch <doctomoe@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r3.ebuild :
  Marked ppc stable

  21 Jan 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r3.ebuild :
  Another libpng-1.0 related fix. Now made sure all -lpng are replaced by lpng10, as quite often
  gcc tries to link against libpng.so.3 instead of libpng.so.2. See #12433.
  As the fixed problem tends to lead to silent failures, -r bumping the ebuild to force rebuild.

*graphviz-1.8.10-r2 (14 Jan 2003)

  14 Jan 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r2.ebuild :

  Following up on seemant's fix to libpng-1.0 series upated the graphviz ebuild to link against correct 
  version of libpng. Please see #10726 for more details.

*graphviz-1.8.10-r1 (10 Nov 2002)

  10 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10-r1.ebuild, files/ :

  removed libpng dependency and made package compile without libpng. 
  Reason: at the moment this is the only app left in portage that depends on libpng-1.0 
  series (often won't compile against 1.2) and libpng-1.0 is creating a lot of trouble 
  for example with kdelibs. See #10726 for details.

*graphviz-1.8.10 (10 Nov 2002)

  10 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.8.10.ebuild :
   new version.
   Fixes some weird issue, possibly libpng related. This app still depends on libpng-1.0.x!!
   Corrected the dependency. See #9702 for more details.

*graphviz-1.7.15-r2 (12 Apr 2002)

  14 Aug 2002; Pieter Van den Abeele <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> :
  Added ppc keyword

  12 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> graphviz-1.7.15-r2.ebuild :

  Compile against newest libpng
