  stable on ppc64, bug #57151

  06 Nov 2003; Mamoru KOMACHI <usata@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r3.ebuild,
  xv-3.10a-r5.ebuild, xv-3.10a-r6.ebuild:
  Changed to LIBDIR=/dev/null. xvdocs.ps was installed to /usr/lib
  (not a directory, but a file called /usr/lib !) due to absence of
  /usr/lib (we should dodir before calling make, if it is really
  necessary in the ebuild), but anyhow we dodoc xvdocs.ps in
  src_install so we don't need it.

*xv-3.10a-r2 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-xv-3.10a-r2 :

  NAZ (from #gentoo) enhanced the patch so that app-shells/tcsh does not have
  to be a compile-time dependency.

*xv-3.10a-r1 (29 Apr 2002)

  29 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xv-3.10a-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-xv-3.10a-r1 files/xv-naz-gentoo.patch :

  This patch, submitted by NAZ (from #gentoo) now brings in png, jpeg and tiff
  support.  The only issue is that, if you want support for one of those, you
  get to have support for all of them.  While unfortunate, this unavoidable, due
  to the manner in which xv's Makefiles are laid out.  To think, there actually
  is a configure script.  And also, it's been more than half a decade since
  this package came out -- you'd think the author would issue an upgrade.

  25 Apr 2002; Thilo Bangert <bangert@gentoo.org> :
  
  switched to || die - added description

*xv-3.10a (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
