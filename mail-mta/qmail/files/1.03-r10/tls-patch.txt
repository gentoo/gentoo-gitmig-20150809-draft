This patch implements RFC2487 in qmail. This means you can 
get SSL or TLS encrypted and authenticated SMTP between 
the MTAs and from MUA to MTA. 
The code is considered experimental (but has worked for
many since its first release on 1999-03-21).

Usage: - install OpenSSL-0.9.6g http://www.openssl.org/
         (any 0.9.6 version is presumed to work)
       - apply patch to qmail-1.03 http://www.qmail.org/ 
         The patches to qmail-remote.c
         and qmail-smtpd.c can be applied separately.
       - provide a server certificate in /var/qmail/control/servercert.pem.
         "make cert" makes a self-signed certificate.
         "make cert-req" makes a certificate request.
         Note: you can add the CA certificate and intermediate
         certs to the end of servercert.pem.
       - replace qmail-smtpd and/or qmail-remote binary
       - verify operation (header information should show
         something like
         "Received [..] with DES-CBC3-SHA encrypted SMTP;")
         If you don't have a server to test with, you can test
         by sending mail to tag-ping@tbs-internet.com,
         which will bounce your mail.

Optional: - when DEBUG is defined, some extra TLS info will be logged
          - qmail-remote will authenticate with the certificate in
            /var/qmail/control/clientcert.pem. By preference this is
            the same as servercert.pem, where nsCertType should be 
            == server,client or be a generic certificate (no usage specified). 
          - when a 512 RSA key is provided in /var/qmail/control/rsa512.pem,
            this key will be used instead of on-the-fly generation by
       	    qmail-smtpd. Periodical replacement can be done by crontab:
       	    01 01 * * *  umask 0077; /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl genrsa \
       	     -out /var/qmail/control/rsa512.new 512 > /dev/null 2>&1 &&\
       	     chown qmaild:qmail /var/qmail/control/rsa512.new && /bin/mv -f \
       	     /var/qmail/control/rsa512.new /var/qmail/control/rsa512.pem
          - server authentication:
            qmail-remote requires authentication from servers for which
            /var/qmail/control/tlshosts/host.dom.ain.pem exists.
            The .pem file contains the validating CA certificates
            (or self-signed server certificate).
            CommonName has to match.
            WARNING: this option may cause mail to be delayed, bounced,
            doublebounced, and lost.
          - client authentication:
            when relay rules would reject an incoming mail, 
            qmail-smtpd can allow the mail based on a presented cert.
            Certs are verified against a CA list in 
            /var/qmail/control/clientca.pem (eg. http://www.modssl.org/
            source/cvs/exp/mod_ssl/pkg.mod_ssl/pkg.sslcfg/ca-bundle.crt)
            and the cert email-address has to match a line in
            /var/qmail/control/tlsclients. This email-address is logged
            in the headers.
          - cipher selection:
            qmail-remote: 
              openssl cipher string (`man ciphers`) read from 
              /var/qmail/control/tlsclientciphers
            qmail-smtpd: 
              openssl cipher string read from TLSCIPHERS environment variable
              (can vary based on client IP address e.g.)
              or if that is not available /var/qmail/control/tlsserverciphers
          - smtps (deprecated SMTP over TLS via port 465):
            qmail-remote: when connecting to port 465 
            qmail-smtpd: when SMTPS environment variable is not empty

Caveats: - do a `make clean` after patching
         - binaries dynamically linked with current openssl versions need
           recompilation when the shared openssl libs are upgraded.
         - this patch could conflict with other patches (notably those
           replacing \n with \r\n, which is a bad idea on encrypted links).
         - some broken servers have a problem with TLSv1 compatibility.
           Uncomment the line where we set the SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 option.
         - needs working /dev/urandom (or EGD for openssl versions >0.9.7)
           for seeding random number generator.
         - packagers should make sure that installing without a valid 
           servercert is impossible
         - when applied in combination with AUTH patch, AUTH patch
           should be applied first and first part of this patch
           will fail. This error can be ignored. Packagers should
           cut the first 12 lines of this patch to make a happy
           patch
