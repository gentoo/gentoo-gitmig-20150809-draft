What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that 
makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts and idle 
handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. it's a separate library so anyone can make 
use of the work put into Ecore to make this job easy for applications.
