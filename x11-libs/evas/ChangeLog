*evas-0.6.0 (20 Apr 2002)

  20 Apr 2002; Leigh Dyer <lsd@linuxgamers.net> evas-0.6.0.ebuild:
  Initial add to portage. Be sure to try evas_test once you've merged it.
  Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
  anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well
  as drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and
  rectangles for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow
