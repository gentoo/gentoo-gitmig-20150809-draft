*gtk+-2.0.5-r2 (15 Jul 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk+-2.0.5-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-gtk+-2.0.5-r2 :

  directfb enabled GTK is now a patch on our mirrors instead of being a
  separate tarball.  This makes the behaviour better for portage's server
  side caching.

*gtk+-2.0.5-r1 (03 Jul 2002)

  03 Jul 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk+-2.0.5-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-gtk+-2.0.5-r1 :

  The DirectFB tarball was replaced on the directfb.org server with one that
  has bugfixes in it.  No need for paranoia, the directfb folks have
  verified it for us.  Thanks to: gentoo@tuurlijk.eu.org (Tuurlijk!) in bug
  #4451 for spotting it.

*gtk+-2.0.5 (17 Jun 2002)

  17 Jun 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gtk+-2.0.5.ebuild

  files/digest-gtk+-2.0.3-r1 :

  Option for directfb-patched gtk libs.  This actually gets and compiles a
  separate source tarball from directfb.org

*gtk+-2.0.3 (28 May 2002)

  23 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gtk+-2.0.2-r5.ebuild:
  seems people who installed with the libtoolized version of gtk+ fails
  when installing gtk+ again.  Test this version if it works (read
libtoolize)

  22 May 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> gtk+-2.0.2-r4.ebuild:
