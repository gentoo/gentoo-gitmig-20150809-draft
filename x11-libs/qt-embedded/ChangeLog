*qt-embedded-3.1.2 (20 Jul 2003)

  20 Jul 2003; Caleb Tennis <caleb@gentoo.org> qt-embedded-3.1.2.ebuild:
 
  Providing the latest stable version of Qt Embedded due to request from
  users.  It compiles and installs fine for me, but there may be some conflicts
  with the existing Qt-free ebuild installation.  Only time will tell.

*qt-embedded-3.0.5 (26 Aug 2002)

  26 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

  Qt Embedded is a qt that runs in a frambuffer on a wide variedy of
  platforms. (We're going to use it in the Gentoo installer). This is the
  initial ebuild. It's still masked and in testing.
