*fribidi-0.10.4 (01 Apr 2003)

  05 Jul 2003; Masatomo Nakano <nakano@gentoo.org> fribidi-0.10.4.ebuild:
  Marked as stable(x86,ppc)

  04 Jun 2003; Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org> fribidi-0.10.4.ebuild :
  Added ~ppc keyword

  08 Apr 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> fribidi-0.10.4.ebuild:
  At the same time I added this ebuild to dev-libs, foser added a very similar
  one to app-text. We've discovered this now and will keep his ebuild (which is
  better) in dev-libs (which is a more logical location). So, this is his
  ebuild.

  01 Apr 2003; danarmak <danarmak@gentoo.org> fribidi-0.10.4.ebuild:
  fribidi is a library implementing the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
  standard, used to output RTL text (fex. Hebrew and Arabic). gnome's pango
  actually uses a customized copy of it. Original submission by Edy (bug #7856).
