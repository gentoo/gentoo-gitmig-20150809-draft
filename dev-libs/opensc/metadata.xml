ibopensc is a library for accessing SmartCard devices. It is also the core library of the OpenSC 
project. 

Basic functionality (e.g. SELECT FILE, READ BINARY) should work on any ISO 7816-4 compatible SmartCard. 
Encryption and decryption using private keys on the SmartCard is possible with PKCS #15 compatible 
cards, such as the FINEID (Finnish Electronic IDentity) card.
