  13 May 2003; Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.12.ebuild:
  adding ~alpha keyword.

  10 May 2003; <jrray@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.12.ebuild:
  Making the doctype depends optional based on the doc use variable. Closes bug
  19535.

*libgcrypt-1.1.12 (08 Feb 2003)

  08 Feb 2003; J Robert Ray <jrray@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.12 : Version bump,
  all the docbook-sgml-utils issues should be sorted out.  The configure script
  needs a working docbook environment or else it prints out a warning, then
  goes on to never actually use it.  Since it is conceivable that it may be
  used or needed in the future, I'm leaving the dependencies in place for now.

*libgcrypt-1.1.10 (4 Feb 2003)

  04 Feb 2003; Yannick Koehler <ykoehler@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.10.ebuild
  files/digest-libgcrypt-1.1.10 :

  Version bump.

  03 Jan 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Changed docbook2X dependency to docbook-sgml-utils, as both have the same
  results and docbook-sgml-utils is more dependable, although I can't really
  tell where the docbook2X system is used in this.

  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*libgcrypt-1.1.8 (12 Oct 2002)

  12 Oct 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> libgcrypt-1.1.8.ebuild
  files/digest-libgcrypt-1.1.8 :

  Version bump.  License is now LGPL-2.1 unless using a unix without
  /dev/random or windows, in which case use GPL-2.  Removed myconf settings 
  from 1.1.3 since README mentioned nothing about them.  Added docs in 
  src_install.

*libgcrypt-1.1.3 (15 Mar 2002 )

  13 Aug 2002; Pieter Van den Abeele <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  Added ppc keyword

  15 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  This library is necessary for the new release of aide (intrusion detection)
  version 0.8

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
