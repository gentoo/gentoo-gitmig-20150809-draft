*log4cpp-0.3.4b (27 Nov 2002)

  11 Dec 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> log4cpp-0.3.4b.ebuild :

  some cleanups to src_install by Michael and me.

  27 Nov 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> log4cpp-0.3.4b.ebuild, files/digest-log4cpp-0.3.4b :
 
  New ebuild. See #10408.
  Log4cpp is library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files, syslog, IDSA and other destinations. 
  It is modeled after the Log4j Java library, staying as close to their API as is reasonable.

  ebuild submitted by Michael Labhard <ince@pacifier.com>
