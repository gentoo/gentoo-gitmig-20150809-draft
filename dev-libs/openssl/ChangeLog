*openssl-0.9.6e (30 Jul 2002)

  2 Aug 2002; Calum Selkirk <cselkirk@gentoo.org> openssl-0.9.6e.ebuild :

  Added ppc to KEYWORDS.

  30 Jul 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> openssl-0.9.6e.ebuild :

  New version to fix security, http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt

*openssl-0.9.6d-r1 (10 Jul 2002)

  10 Jul 2002; Josh Tegart <jtegart@gentoo.org> : 

  Fixed problem that prevented openssl-0.9.6d from building on sparc. The 
  Configure script incorrectly set the SHARED_LDFLAGS in the Makefile. The new 
  ebuild simply removes the incorrect value if ARCH="sparc".
  
*openssl-0.9.6d (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  Update to latest.  Added LICENSE, SLOT.  Use make vs. emake.

*openssl-0.9.6c-r1 (3 Apr 2002)

  patch from src_unpack; it was redundant.  Remove the manpage sed stuff
  and pass MANDIR to make install instead.  Fix a longstanding annoyance
  with the support scripts getting installed into /usr/ssl and install
  them in the proper place: /usr/lib/ssl.  Add a patch for compiling with
  gcc-3.  Fix a glitch with the html docs getting installed into a redundant
  'doc' subdirectory.  Remove all old patches, digests and ebuilds.

  21 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : Fixed 0.9.6c ebuild so
  that it doesn't do 'sed -e "foo" | cat > Makefile', which breaks often.  Now
  it is a standard 2-liner.

  21 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> openssl-0.9.6c.ebuild :
  Fixed so that html documentation is no longer gzipped.  Small enough to not
  warrant a revision bump on the ebuild.

*openssl-0.9.6c (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
