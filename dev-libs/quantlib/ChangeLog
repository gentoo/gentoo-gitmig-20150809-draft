  The QuantLib project is aimed to provide a  
  comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance.  
  The goal is to provide a standard free/open source 
  library to quantitative analysts and developers for modeling,  
  trading, and risk management in real-life. 
   
  QuantLib plans to offer tools that are useful for both  
  practical implementation, with features such as market  
  conventions, solvers, PDEs,etc.,  
  and advanced modeling,  
  e.g., exotic options and interest rate models.
