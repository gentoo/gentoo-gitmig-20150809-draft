    In a nutshell TomsFastMath is meant to be a portable fixed precision math 
    library geared towards doing one thing very fast. Exponentiations. The modular 
    kind. Like what you find in RSA and DH. Though TomsFastMath (TFM) is not 
    limited solely to doing RSA or DH. It's generic enough to be used for other 
    projects such as ECC as well.
