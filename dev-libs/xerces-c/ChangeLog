  16 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0-r2.ebuild:
  Removed the old xerces-c-2.3.0.ebuild because it was majorly borked. I added a
  simple dolib statement to the -r2 to install the libraries (duh). Thanks to
  Apache XML for their great docs (right, b0rked).

  09 Jun 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> xerces-c-2.3.0.ebuild:
  Fixed a major prob w/ 2.3.0 installing into /include ::oops::. I marked it
  -x86 -ppc and will await a couple of days before removing it from portage. To
  -r1, I fixed the /include problem, and added the 'doc' use flag, cause there
  are an awful lot of docs.
