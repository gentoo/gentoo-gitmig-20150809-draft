                     Yahoo! Messenger Terms of Service

   1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
   Welcome to Yahoo Messenger. Yahoo provides this service to you,
   subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be
   updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review
   the most current version of the TOS at any time at:
   [5]http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/messenger.html. BY CLICKING THE "I
   ACCEPT" BUTTON (IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL YAHOO MESSENGER ON
   YOUR COMPUTER) YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TOS.
   2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
   Yahoo Messenger (the "Service") provides users with the capability to
   see when their friends are online, send and receive instant messages,
   electronic mail, alerts and other material and information via the
   World Wide Web. By registering and using the Service, you acknowledge
   that other users of the Service may elect to receive a notification
   from the Service when you sign on and may send you instant messages
   and other information via the Service. If you desire to block the
   notification feature of the Service sent to other users or if you
   don't want to receive messages from such users, you can enable the
   "Ignore" feature of the Service. The "Ignore" feature allows you to
   create a list of users you wish to block that you can review and edit
   from time to time. Your ability to send and receive instant messages
   and other information may be blocked by Yahoo and by other users,
   which may partially or wholly limit your ability to use the Service.
   By using the Service, you agree that Yahoo has no responsibility for
   the assessment, or for resolving any disputes arising from a User's
   ability to ignore, send messages or otherwise use the Service.
   In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide
   Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content,
   and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you
   must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the
   World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device.
   The Service and any necessary software used in connection with the
   Service ("Software") contain proprietary and confidential information
   that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.
   Yahoo grants you a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right
   and license to use the object code of the Software on a single
   computer; provided that you do not (and do not allow any third party
   to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer,
   reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code,
   sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise
   transfer any right in the Software. You agree not to modify the
   Software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the
   Software, including (without limitation) for the purpose of obtaining
   unauthorized access to the Service. All Software provided to the U.S.
   Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1,
   1995 is provided with the commercial rights and restrictions described
   herein. In addition, you agree that the Software may not be acquired,
   shipped, transported, exported, or reexported (1) into (or to a
   national or resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (2) to anyone
   on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated
   Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.
   By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not
   located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such
   country or on any such list.
   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or
   enhance the current Service, shall be subject to the TOS. You
   understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that
   Yahoo assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion,
   mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or
   personalization settings. You also understand that Yahoo is not
   responsible for the security or privacy of communications sent via the
   Service where the Service is being accessed via wireless devices.
   3. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
   If you don't already have a YahooID and password, you will be prompted
   to complete the Yahoo registration process. You are responsible for
   maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are
   fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or
   account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Yahoo of any unauthorized
   use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and
   (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.
   Yahoo cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising
   from your failure to comply with this Section 3. The Service may allow
   you to communicate with users of other instant messaging products. In
   that event, you acknowledge and agree that (i) your use of the Service
   is subject to the TOS and the terms governing the use of other instant
   messaging products you have agreed to, if any, that are consistent
   with the TOS and (ii) users of other instant messaging products are
   subject to the terms governing such other instant messaging products.
   Yahoo assumes no responsibility for the conduct or content of messages
   sent by users of other instant messaging products.

   our Privacy Policy. For more information, please see our full privacy

   The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Yahoo and

   between you and Yahoo. You also may be subject to additional terms and
   conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party
   content or third-party software. The TOS and the relationship between
   you and Yahoo shall be governed by the laws of the State of California
   without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Yahoo agree
   to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
   located within the county of Santa Clara, California. The failure of
   Yahoo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall
   not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
   of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
   invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor
   to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the
   provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force
   and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
   contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to

   that you will not export or re-export the Software, any part thereof,
   or any process or service that is the direct product of the Software
   (the foregoing collectively referred to as the "Restricted
   Components"), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S. export
   restrictions. The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only
   and have no legal or contractual effect.
