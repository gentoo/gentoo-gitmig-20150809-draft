  10 Jun 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rrdtool-1.0.35-r3.ebuild
  files/digest-rrdtool-1.0.35-r3 :

  Made fixes so it installs the binaries into /usr/bin and there are also
  some perl specific things that need to be done (perl was made an optional
  dep) which are done through the perl-module eclass now.

*rrdtool-1.0.35-r1 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> rrdtool-1.0.35-r1.ebuild

  Replaced the tcl USE flag with tcltk instead, since the latter encapsulates
  the former, and this is the only ebuild that uses the former.
