<title>Keychain Intro</title>

<p>
Many of us use the excellent <uri
link="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</uri> as a secure, encrypted replacement
for the venerable telnet and rsh commands.  One of OpenSSH's more intriguing
features is its ability to authenticate users using the RSA and DSA
authentication protocols, which are based upon a pair of complementary
numerical "keys".  And one of the main appeals of RSA and DSA authentication is the
promise of being able to establish connections to remote systems <e>without
supplying a password</e>.  The <c>keychain</c> bash script makes handling RSA and
DSA keys both convenient and secure.  It acts as a front-end to <c>ssh-agent</c>,
but allows you to easily have one long-running <c>ssh-agent</c> process <e>per system</e>,
rather than per login session.  This dramatically reduces the number of times you need
to enter your passphrase from once per new login session to once <e>every time your local
machine is rebooted.</e>

<p>Above, <c>drobbins</c> logs in to <c>cvs.gentoo.org</c>, and <c>keychain</c>
(called from <path>~/.bash_profile</path>) starts up.  <c>keychain</c> detects
a long-running <c>ssh-agent</c> process that already holds <c>drobbins</c>'
private keys and configures the shell environment appropriately.  Because
<c>keychain</c> "hooks in" to an existing <c>ssh-agent</c> process,
<c>drobbins</c> gains access to his keys without typing in his
passphrases, even though he just opened a brand new login session.  He can now
establish secure passwordless connections with any host configured to recognize
these keys.  In fact, <c>drobbins</c> will only need to enter his
passphrases again after <c>cvs.gentoo.org</c> is rebooted.  That's the only
time you really need to reinitialize the long-running <c>ssh-agent</c> process.

<title>The IBM developerWorks articles</title>
<section>
<body>

<p><c>keychain</c> was first introduced in a series of <uri
link="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks">IBM developerWorks</uri> articles.
<b><uri link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc.html">The first
keychain article</uri></b> introduces the concepts behind RSA/DSA key
authentication and shows you how to set up primitive (with passphrase) RSA/DSA
authentication, while the <b>second article</b> (<e>coming soon!</e>) shows you how to
use <c>keychain</c> to set up secure, <e>passwordless</e> <c>ssh</c> access in an
extremely convenient way.  <c>keychain</c> also provides a clean, secure way for
<c>cron</c> jobs to take advantage of RSA/DSA keys without having to use insecure
unencrypted private keys.
