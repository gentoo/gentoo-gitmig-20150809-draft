<title>The Portage Tree</title>

<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body><p>The portage tree is a heirarchy, in which the first level is the category,
and the second is the name of the package.
</p></body>
</section>

<section>
<title> What (Not) to Put in the Portage Tree</title>
<body><p>The portage tree should only include ebuild files, and other
files in the 'files' directory for each package. No binary
files should be placed in the portage tree. No files that can
be downloaded from other sources (such as patches written by
other people) should be put here. No patches you write
yourself should be compressed.
</p></body>
</section>

<title>The files Directory</title>
<body><p>Under each package subdirectory is a 'files' directory. You
should place any patches, configuration files, and other
auxillary files your package might require in this
directory. Patches you create yourself just to get your
package to build should be called '${PF}-gentoo.diff'. You
should not compress these diffs, since 1) they should not be big
enough to require compressing, and 2) cvs does not play well
with binary files.
</p><p>Please add a suffix or prefix such as ${PVR} to the tail of every file you put into
the files directory, so that the files used for each
individual version of your ebuild scripts are distinguishable
from one another, and so that the changes between different
revisions are visible.
</p><p>If you have many files that should go into the files
directory, you should create a subdirectory files/${PVR}, and put all these files
in there. If you use this method, you do not need to suffix
the names of the files in this directory with the ebuild version.

<chapter link="ebuild_files">
<title>.ebuild Files</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body><p>.ebuild files are the basis for the entire portage
system. They contain all the information required to build a
package, and every installed package requires one of these
files. .ebuild files are essentially just bash scripts that
contain a few functions and environment variable settings. The
ebuild command takes care of the rest of the details, such as
merging the package into the filesystem and recording the
package into the package database.
</p></body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Naming .ebuild Files</title>
<body><p>.ebuild file names are in four sections:</p>
<p>The first section is the package name, which should only
contain lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, and hyphen ('-')
characters.
</p><p>The second section is the version of the package, which should
normally be the same as the version on the main source
tarball. The version is normally made up of 2 or 3 numbers
separated by periods, such as 1.2 or 4.5.2, and may have a
single letter immidiately following the last digit, e.g., 1.4b
or 2.6h. This letter should *not* be used to signify alpha or
beta status for the package. There are 3 special suffixes that
may be used for these packages: _alpha, _beta, and _pre. Each
of these suffixes may be immediately followed my a number,
e.g., 'linux-2.4.0_pre10'.
</p><p>The third section of the package name is the revision number,
which is specified by -r#, where '#' is a number,
e.g. 'package-4.5.3-r3'. This revision number is independent of
the version of the source tarball, but if you need to make
non-trivial changes to your .ebuild file, you should copy the
.ebuild file to a new file with the revision number
incremented by 1. Initial releases normally have no revision
number, e.g. 'package-4.5.3'.
</p><p>The fourth section of the .ebuild file name is always the
.ebuild extension.
</p></body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Contents of an .ebuild File</title>
<body><p>1. Variable Settings:
</p><p>The first part of every ebuild file is made up of a number of
variable settings. The variables you can set are:</p>
<ul>
<li>P - the name name and version of the package; you should not need to set this, as it is determined from the name of the ebuild file
</li><li>A - the name (without the path) of the main archive file for your package
</li><li>S - the source directory for your package; normally ${WORKDIR}/${P}
</li><li>DESCRIPTION - a short, one line description of your package
</li><li>SRC_URI - the URIs for every source file in your package, separated by whitespace; normally the first one is something like "ftp://ftp.company.com/pub/somepackage/${A}"
</li><li>HOMEPAGE - your package's homepage
</li><li>DEPEND - build dependencies; see the section <a href="#dependencies">Package Dependencies</a>
</li><li>RDEPEND - runtime dependencies; see the section <a href="#dependencies">Package Dependencies</a>
</li></ul>

<section>
<title>Introduction to the FHS</title>
<body>
<p>The filesystem standard used in Gentoo Linux is the FHS,
short for Filesystem Heirarchy Standard, version 2.0. A simplified
description of the standard is given here; for a complete
specification go to <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/fhs/">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/fhs/</a>.</p>

<title>The Portage Scripts and Utilities</title>

<section>
<title>Public Scripts</title>
<body><p>These are scripts used by the system-administrator to install and remove packages, and maintain the package database.</p>
<ul>
<li>ebuild - the main engine of the Portage system; performs all major tasks such as unpacking, compiling, installing, merging, and unmerging packages
</li><li>portage-maintain - compares the list of available and merged packages to show which can be upgraded
</li><li>pkgmerge - merges a pre-packaged .tbz2 file for a package
</li></ul>
