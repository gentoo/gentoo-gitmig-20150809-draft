<abstract>
These instructions step you through the process of installing Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 using
our minimal build CD.  Using this method, the complete system is built from scratch using
sources that are automatically downloaded from the Internet.  This build CD install method
will work with any x86-compatible system.

<title>About the Install</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>The Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 ISO release is based upon a new <c>isolinux/zdisk</c>-based
boot process.  This new boot CD will boot from nearly any modern IDE CD-ROM drive,
as well as almost any modern SCSI CD-ROM.  Included on the CD-ROM is Linux support for
IDE (built-in to the kernel) as well as support for all SCSI devices (available as 
modules).  In addition, we provide modules for literally every kind of network card
that Linux supports.  The installation works by using a small included build image as
a base to download and install packages whose sources are downloaded from the Internet.</p>

<p>To install from the build CD, you will need to have a 486+ processor, and ideally at
least 64 Megabytes of RAM.  To begin the install process, first grab the 16Mb
build CD ISO image (<path>build-ix86-1.0_rc6-r10.iso</path> is the latest at the time this
article was written) from
<uri>http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/snapshots/build/ix86-linux-gnu/</uri>.  Then, create
your own CD-ROM using this image and your preferred CD burning software.
</p>

<title>Booting</title>

<body>
<p>Now go ahead and boot the CD; you'll be greeted with a bunch of text and a <c>boot:</c>
prompt at the bottom of the screen.  At this prompt, hit enter, and Linux will begin to load
from the CD.</p>
<p>Next, you'll be greeted with a small list of commands available on the boot CD, including
<c>e3pi</c> (a pico editor clone) and the <c>help</c> command.  At this point, you are now in
the minimal boot CD Linux environment.  You should have a root ("<c>#</c>") prompt on the current
console, and can also open new consoles by typing alt-f2, alt-f3, 
etc and then hitting enter.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Load kernel modules</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>We're almost ready to begin installing Gentoo Linux, but first we need take the necessary steps
so that the kernel recognizes our network cards, and optionally any SCSI hardware that is in our
system.  To view a list of all available network card modules, type <c>ls /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/net/*</c>.
To load a particular module, type:</p>

<pre>
# <i>modprobe pcnet32</i>
	<comment>(replace pcnet32 with your NIC module)</comment>
</pre>

<impo><path>build-1.0_rc6-r10.iso</path> and later include <c>modprobe</c>; all earlier CDs include <c>insmod</c>.</impo>

<p>Now, if you want to be able to access any SCSI hardware, you will need to load the appropriate
modules from /lib/modules, again using <c>modprobe</c>:</p>
<pre>
# <i>modprobe aic7xxx</i>
# <i>modprobe sr_mod</i>
# <i>modprobe sd_mod</i>
</pre>
<p>Above, we modprobe the <c>aic7xxx</c> SCSI driver and then make sure that SCSI CD-ROM (<c>sr_mod</c>)
and disk (<c>sd_mod</c>) support is loaded.</p>
<note><c>hdparm</c> is now included on -r10 and later of the iso.  If any of your drives require tweaking, now
would be a good time to do so.</note>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>Set up partitions</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Now that the kernel can see our network card and disk controllers, it's time
to set up disk partitions for Gentoo Linux.</p>

<p>Here's a quick overview of the standard Gentoo Linux partition layout.
We're going to create at least three partitions: a swap partition, a root
partition (to hold the bulk of Gentoo Linux), and a special boot partition.
The boot partition is designed to hold GRUB boot loader information as well as
your Linux kernel(s).  The boot partition gives us a safe place to store
everything related to booting Linux. During normal day-to-day Gentoo Linux use,
your boot partition should remain <e>unmounted</e>.  This prevents your kernel
from being made unavailable to GRUB (due to filesystem corruption) in the event
of a system crash, preventing the chicken-and-egg problem where GRUB can't read
your kernel (since your filesystem isn't consistent) but you can't bring your
filesystem back to a consistent state (since you can't boot!)      </p>

<p>Now, on to filesystem types.  Right now, you have three filesystem options:
ext2, ext3 (journalling) and ReiserFS.  ext2 is the tried and true Linux
filesystem but doesn't have metadata journalling.  ext3 is the new version of
ext2 with both metadata journalling and ordered data writes, effectively
providing data journalling as well.  ReiserFS is a B*-tree based filesystem
with very good small file performance, and greatly outperforms both ext2 and
ext3 when dealing with small files (files less than 4k), often by a factor of
10x-15x.  ReiserFS has metadata journalling, but no data journalling.  If
you're looking for the most standard filesystem, use ext2.  If you're looking
for the most rugged journaled filesystem, use ext3.  If you're looking for a
high-performance filesystem with journalling support, use ReiserFS.  Both ext3
and ReiserFS are production-ready.  Here are our basic recommended filesystem
sizes and types:</p>

  <table>
  <tr>
  	<th>Partition</th>
	<th>Size</th>
	<th>Type</th>
  	<th>example device</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<ti>boot partition, containing kernel(s) and boot information</ti>
	<ti>&gt;10 Megabytes</ti>
	<ti>ext2 highly recommended (easiest) or ReiserFS, if reiserfs then mount with <c>-o notail</c></ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda1</ti>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  	<ti>swap partition (no longer a 128 Megabyte limit)</ti>
	<ti>&gt;=2*Amount of RAM in this system</ti>
	<ti>Linux swap</ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda2</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<ti>root partition, containing main filesystem (/usr, /home, etc)</ti>
	<ti>&gt;=1.5 Gigabytes</ti>
	<ti>ReiserFS, ext3, ext2 ok</ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda3</ti>
  </tr>
 </table>

<note>At this point, create your partitions using fdisk.  Note that your partitions
should be of type 0x82 if swap and 0x83 for regular filesystems (whether ReiserFS <e>or</e> ext2).
</note>

<p>Once you've created your partitions using <c>fdisk</c>, it's time to initialize
the filesystems that will be used to house our data.  Initialize swap as follows:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkswap /dev/hda2</i>
</pre>
<p>You can use the <c>mke2fs</c> command to create ext2 filesystems:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mke2fs /dev/hda1</i>
</pre>
<p>To create ReiserFS filesystems, use the <c>mkreiserfs</c> command:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkreiserfs /dev/hda3</i>
</pre>
<p>If you'd like to use ext3, first make sure that the <path>ext3.o</path> module is loaded:</p>
<pre>
# <i>modprobe ext3</i>
</pre>
<p>Then, you can create ext3 filesystems using <c>mke2fs -j</c>:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mke2fs -j /dev/hda3</i>
</pre>

<note>You can find out more about using ext3 under Linux 2.4 at <uri>http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/ext3-usage.html</uri>.</note>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>Mount partitions</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Now, we'll activate our new swap, since we may need the additional virtual memory that
provides later:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>swapon /dev/hda2</i>
</pre>
<p>Next, we'll create the <path>/mnt/gentoo</path> and <path>/mnt/gentoo/boot</path> mountpoints,
and we'll mount our filesystems to these mountpoints.  Note that we use the special <c>-o notail</c>
option when we mount our ReiserFS boot partition.</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
# <i>mount -o notail /dev/hda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
</pre>
<p>If you are setting up Gentoo
   Linux with a separate <path>/usr</path> or <path>/var</path>, these would get mounted to
   <path>/mnt/gentoo/usr</path> and <path>/mnt/gentoo/var</path>, respectively.
</p>
   <impo>If your <e>boot</e> partition (the one holding the kernel) is ReiserFS, be sure to mount it
   with the <c>-o notail</c> option so GRUB gets properly installed.  Make sure 
   that <c>notail</c> ends up in your new <path>/etc/fstab</path> boot partition entry, too.
   We'll get to that in a bit.</impo>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Mounting the CD-ROM</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Even though we've booted from the CD-ROM, the CD-ROM itself is not mounted under our minimal
Linux boot CD environment.  We'll need to mount it so that we can access the compressed build image
tarball contained on the CD-ROM.  To mount the CD-ROM, one typically types:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>mount /dev/cdroms/cdrom0 /mnt/cdrom -o ro -t iso9660</i>
</pre>
<p>With the CD-ROM mounted, you should be able to see the <c>build-???.tbz2</c> file by typing
<c>ls /mnt/cdrom</c>.</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
    <title>Unpack the build archive and chroot</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Now it's time to extract the compressed build image tarball to <path>/mnt/gentoo</path>.  Then, we'll <c>chroot</c> over to the new Gentoo Linux build installation. 
</p>

<pre>
# <i>cd /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>tar -xvjpf /mnt/cdrom/build-*.tbz2</i>
# <i>mount -o bind /proc /mnt/gentoo/proc</i>
# <i>chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash</i>
# <i>env-update</i>
Regenerating /etc/ld.so.cache...
# <i>source /etc/profile</i>
none / # <comment>ooh!  A new prompt!</comment>
</pre>
<p>
We make the <path>/proc</path> filesystem accessible inside the 
soon-to-be-established chroot by binding it to <path>/mnt/gentoo/proc</path>
(it's always good to ensure that <path>/proc</path> is available).
</p>
<p>After you execute these commands, you'll be "inside" your new Gentoo Linux environment,
and the last step before we can grab the Portage tree and bootstrap is to configure your network settings.
</p>

<title>Configure installation networking</title>
<section>
<title>DHCP</title>
<body>
<p>
Network configuration is simple with DHCP; If your ISP is not using
DHCP, skip down to the static configuration section below.
</p>
<pre caption="Network configuration with DHCP">
# <i>dhcpcd eth0</i> 
</pre>
<note>
Some ISPs require you to provide a hostname.  To do that,
add a <c>-h myhostname</c> flag to the dhcpcd command line above.
</note>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Static configuration</title>
<body>
<p>
We need to setup just enough networking so that we can download
sources for the system build, as well as the required localhost interface.  Type in the following commands, replacing
$IFACE with your network interface (typically <c>eth0</c>), $IPNUM
with your IP address, $BCAST with your broadcast address, and $NMASK
with your network mask.  For the <c>route</c> command, replace 
$GTWAY with your default gateway.
</p>
<pre>
# <i>/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up</i>
# <i>/sbin/ifconfig $IFACE $IPNUM broadcast $BCAST netmask $NMASK</i>
# <i>/sbin/route add -net default gw $GTWAY netmask 0.0.0.0 metric 1</i>
</pre>
<p>Now, it's time to create the <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>
file so that name resolution (finding Web/FTP sites by name, rather than just by IP address) will work.</p>

<note>At the moment the only editor installed by default is <c>e3</c>, a
small, basic editor, written in Nasm asm.  It has keybindings for vi,
emacs, pico, nedit, and wordstar.  If you aren't familiar with any
of those editors, just type <c>e3</c>, and you will get the default
pico keybindings which are pretty easy to work with.  To get the other
keybindings, try <c>e3vi</c>, <c>e3em</c>, <c>e3pi</c>, <c>e3ne</c>,
<c>e3ws</c>, respectively.</note>

<p>Here's a template to follow for creating your /etc/resolv.conf file:
</p>
<pre caption="/etc/resolv.conf template">
domain mydomain.com
nameserver 10.0.0.1
nameserver 10.0.0.2
</pre>
<p>Replace <c>10.0.0.1</c> and <c>10.0.0.2</c> with the IP addresses of your
primary and secondary DNS servers respectively.</p>
<p>Now that your network has been configured, the <c>/sbin/ifconfig -a</c> command should show (hopefully!) 
that your network card is working
(look for <e>UP</e> and <e>RUNNING</e> in the output).
</p>
<pre caption="/sbin/ifconfig for a working network card">
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:BA:8F:61:7A

<chapter>
<title>Rsync</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Now that you have networking properly configured, we need to complete the all-important <c>emerge rsync</c> step,
which will download an up-to-the-minute copy of the Gentoo Linux Portage tree from gentoo.org.  Simply type:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge rsync</i>
</pre>
<p>The Portage tree will begin to be transferred; it's about 20Mb in size.</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Bootstrap</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Now that you have a working copy of the Portage tree, it's time to bootstrap the system build tools.
First, you need to edit the file <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.  In this file, you
should set your <c>USE</c> flags, which specify optional functionality that you
would like built into packages; the commented-out defaults are recommended.  You also should set appropriate <c>CHOST</c>, <c>
CFLAGS</c> and <c>CXXFLAGS</c> settings for the kind of system that you are creating:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>e3 /etc/make.conf</i> <comment>(Adjust these settings)</comment>
</pre>
<p>Now, it's time to start the "bootstrap" process.  This process will last 1-2 hours depending on 
how zippy your machine is; it takes about 45 minutes on my 900Mhz AMD Athlon system.  During this
time, the extracted build image will be prepped for compiling the rest of the system.  The GNU
compiler suite will be built, as well as the GNU C library.  These are time consuming builds and
make up the bulk of the bootstrap process:</p>
<pre>
# <i>cd /usr/portage</i>
# <i>scripts/bootstrap.sh files/bootstrap-1.0_rc6.packages</i>
</pre>
<p>The "bootstrap" process will now begin.</p>
<note>
Portage by default uses <c>/var/tmp</c> during package building, often
using several hundred megabytes of temporary storage. If you would like to
change where Portage stores these temporary files, set a new PORTAGE_TMPDIR <e>before</e>
starting the bootstrap process, as follows:
</note>
<pre>
# <i>export PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/otherdir/tmp"</i>
</pre>
<p>
The 
<c>bootstrap.sh</c> will build <c>binutils</c>, <c>gcc</c>, <c>gettext</c>,
and <c>glibc</c>, rebuilding <c>binutils</c>, <c>gcc</c>, and <c>gettext</c>
after <c>glibc</c> is built.  Needless to say, this process takes a while.
Have a nice nap.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Building the base system</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Now that the build tools have been built with the proper
optimizations for your system, it's time to build the rest
of the base system:</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge --pretend system</i>
	<comment>[lists the packages to be installed]</comment>
# <i>emerge system</i>
</pre>
<p>
It's going to take a while to finish building the entire base
system.  Your reward is that it will be thoroughly optimized for
your system.  The drawback is that you have to find a way to keep
yourself occupied for some time to come.  The author suggests "Star Wars -
Super Bombad Racing" for the PS2.

<chapter>
<title>Installing the kernel and system logger</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
At the moment the Gentoo Linux default system does not include a kernel;
you have to install it yourself.  Here are the steps to compile and configure
your own custom kernel:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>cd /usr/portage/sys-kernel/linux-sources</i>
# <i>emerge linux-sources-2.4.8.8.ebuild</i>
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
# <i>make dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules; make modules_install</i>
# <i>mv /boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage.orig</i> <comment>[if bzImage already exists]</comment>
# <i>cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot</i>
</pre>
<impo>For your kernel to function properly, there are several options that you will
need to ensure are in the kernel proper -- that is, they should <e>be enabled but not
compiled as modules</e>.
Under the "File systems" section, be sure to enable the "Device File System",
but do <e>not</e> tell the kernel to automatically mount devfs at boot time.  You'll also
need to enable the "Virtual Memory Filesystem".  Be sure to enable "ReiserFS" if you have
any ReiserFS partitions; the same goes for "Ext3".  It's always a good idea to leave ext2
enabled whether you are using it or not.
</impo>

<p>
Your new custom kernel (and modules) are now installed.  Now you need to choose a system
logger that you would like to install.  We offer sysklogd, which is the traditional set
of system logging daemons.  We also have syslog-ng as well as metalog.  Power users seem
to gravitate away from sysklogd (not very good performance) and towards syslog-ng and 
metalog.  If in doubt, you may want to try metalog, since it seems to be quite popular.
To merge your logger of choice, type <e>one</e> of the next three lines:
</p>

<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/sysklogd</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge app-admin/syslog-ng</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge app-admin/metalog</i>
</pre>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Install miscellaneous stuff</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
To install any additional packages in the Portage tree
you can just <c>emerge</c> any packages in <path>/usr/portage/</path>
that you'd
like to install, for example:</p>
<pre>
# <i>cd /usr/portage/x11-base/xfree</i>
# <i>emerge --pretend xfree-4.1.0.ebuild</i>
# <i>emerge xfree-4.1.0.ebuild</i>
</pre>
<p>
It is always a good idea to use the <c>--pretend</c> flag first, just to
get a feeling for what is going to be installed.  Of course, you have a
basic Gentoo Linux system installed now, so any additional packages could
wait until you have the rest of the system configured.  It's generally best
to get your base system booting before merging X. :)
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Final configuration</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Your Gentoo Linux system is almost ready for use.  All we need to do now is configure
a few important system files and install the GRUB boot loader. 
The first file we need to
configure is <path>/etc/fstab</path>.  Here's an example file; remember that you should use
the <c>notail</c> option for your boot partition if you chose to create a ReiserFS filesystem on it.
Remember to specify <c>ext2</c>, <c>ext3</c> or <c>reiserfs</c> filesystem types as appropriate.</p>
<pre>
<comment># /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns of atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't
# needed; notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to 
# switch between notail and tail freely.
#
# &lt;fs&gt;          &lt;mountpoint&gt;    &lt;type&gt;  	&lt;opts&gt;    &lt;dump/pass&gt;
</comment>
/dev/hda1		/boot		reiserfs	notail,noauto,noatime	0 0
<comment># use a dump/pass of "2 2" if your boot filesystem is *not* ReiserFS</comment>
/dev/hda2		none            swap		sw			0 0
/dev/hda3		/		reiserfs	notail,noatime		0 0
<comment># use a dump/pass of "1 1" if your root filesystem is *not* ReiserFS</comment>
/dev/hdc		/mnt/cdrom	iso9660		noauto,ro		0 0
<comment>
# /proc should always be enabled
# no /dev devfs line is needed; mounting /dev is done by our devfs initscript
# usbdevfs taken care of automatically by initscripts
</comment>
proc			/proc           proc		defaults		0 0
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>/etc/localtime</title>
<body>
<p>Look for your timezone (or GMT if you using Greenwich Mean Time) in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>.  Then, make a symbolic link by typing:
</p><pre>
# <i>ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/path/to/timezonefile /etc/localtime</i>
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>/etc/hostname</title>
<body>
<p>Edit this file so that it contains your fully-qualified domain name on a single line, i.e. <c>mymachine.mydomain.com</c>.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>/etc/hosts</title>
<body>
<p>This file contains a list of ip addresses and their associated hostnames.  It's used by the system to resolve the IP addresses
of any hostnames that may not be in your nameservers.  Here's a template for this file:
</p><pre>
127.0.0.1      localhost
<comment># the next line contains your IP for your local LAN, and your associated machine name</comment>
192.168.1.1    mymachine.mydomain.com	mymachine
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Final network configuration</title>
<body>
<p>
Look in <path>/lib/modules</path> for the ethernet module
specific to your particular ethernet card, and append it to the
<path>/etc/modules</path> file (you can also add any options you
need to the same line.)  This should be the same module as you used with
insmod earlier.  When Gentoo Linux boots, this module will be automatically
loaded:
</p>
<pre caption="network config">
# <i>e3 /etc/modules</i>
</pre>
<p>If you have a static IP, use the <c>net.eth0</c> script to get your network
configured for your first boot:</p>
<pre>
# <i>e3 /etc/init.d/net.eth0</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth0 default</i>
</pre>
<p>However, if you have a dynamic IP, do the same thing with <c>net.eth0-dhcp</c>:</p>
<pre>
# <i>e3 /etc/init.d/net.eth0-dhcp</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth0-dhcp default</i>
</pre>
<p>If you need to set up any additional network interfaces, copy <c>net.eth0</c>
or <c>net.eth0-dhcp</c> to <c>net.eth1</c> or <c>net.eth1-dhcp</c> and repeat.</p>
<impo>Once you've set up all your network interfaces, edit <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>
and take a good look at the <c>INTERFACES</c> environment variable.  Make sure it
contains the names of all the network interfaces that should be running all the
time.</impo>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Configure basic settings</title>
<body>
<pre caption="basic configuration">

<title>Configure GRUB</title>
<body>
<p>
The most critical part of understanding GRUB is getting comfortable with how GRUB refers to hard drives and partitions.
Your Linux partition <path>/dev/hda1</path> is called <path>(hd0,0)</path> under GRUB.  Notice the parenthesis around the hd0,0 - they are required.  
Hard drives count from zero rather than "a", and partitions start at zero rather than one.  So, <path>/dev/hdb3</path> gets translated to <path>(hd1,2)</path>, and <path>/dev/hdd7</path> gets translated to <path>(hd3,6)</path>.  After you've gotten the feel for that, convert your boot and root partition names to the GRUB format and write them down.  Now, it's time to install GRUB.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to install grub is to simply type <c>grub</c> at your chrooted shell prompt:
</p><pre>
# <i>grub</i>
</pre><p>You'll be presented with the <c>grub&gt;</c> grub command-line prompt.  Now, you need to type in the
right commands to install the GRUB boot record onto your hard drive.  In my example configuration,
I want to install the GRUB boot record on my hard drive's MBR (master boot record), so that 
the first thing I see when I turn on the computer is the GRUB prompt.  In my case, the commands
I want to type are:</p>
<pre>grub&gt; <i>root (hd0,0)</i>
grub&gt; <i>setup (hd0)</i>
</pre>

<p>Here's how the two commands work.  The first <c>root ( )</c> command tells GRUB
the location of your boot partition (in our example, <path>/dev/hda1</path> or 
<path>(hd0,0)</path> in GRUB terminology.  Then, the second <c>setup ( )</c> command tells GRUB where to install the
boot record - it will be configure to look for its special files at the <c>root
( )</c> location that you specified.  In my case, I want the boot record on the
MBR of the hard drive, so I simply specify <path>/dev/hda</path> (also known as <path>(hd0)</path>).  If I were using
another boot loader and wanted to set up GRUB as a secondary boot-loader, I
could install GRUB to the boot record of a particular partition.  In that case,
I'd specify a particular partition rather than the entire disk.  Once the GRUB
boot record has been 
successfully installed, you can type <c>quit</c> to quit GRUB.  Gentoo Linux is
installed, but we need to create the <path>/boot/grub/menu.lst</path> file so that
we get a nice GRUB boot menu when the system reboots.  Here's how to do it.</p>

<p>Now, create the menu.lst file (<c>e3 /boot/grub/menu.lst</c>), and add the following to it:</p>
<pre>
default 0
timeout 30

title=My example Gentoo Linux
root (hd0,0) 
kernel /boot/bzImage root=/dev/hda3 

title=Windows NT Workstation
root (hd0,5) 
chainloader +1
</pre><p>After saving this file, Gentoo Linux installation is complete.  Selecting the first option will
tell GRUB to boot Gentoo Linux without a fuss.  The second part of the menu.lst file is optional, and shows you how to
use GRUB to boot a bootable Windows partition.</p>

<note>Above, <path>(hd0,0)</path> should point to your "boot" partition
(<path>/dev/hda1</path> in our example config) and <path>/dev/hda3</path> should point to
your root filesystem.  <path>(hd0,5)</path> contains the NT boot
loader.</note> <p>Also, if you need to pass any options to the kernel, simply
add them to the end of the <c>kernel</c> command.  We're already passing one option
(<c>root=/dev/hda3</c>), but you can pass others as well.  In particular, you can
turn off devfs by default (not recommended unless you know what you're doing) by
adding the <c>gentoo=nodevfs</c> option to the <c>kernel</c> command.

<note>Unlike in earlier versions of Gentoo Linux, you no longer have to add 
<c>devfs=mount</c> to the end of the <c>kernel</c> line to enable devfs.  In rc6
devfs is enabled by default.

<p>Now, Gentoo Linux is installed.  The only remaining step is to exit the chrooted shell, safely unmount your partitions
and reboot the system:</p>
<pre>
# <i>exit</i> 
<codenote>This exits the chrooted shell; you can also type <c>^D</c></codenote>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo/proc</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>reboot</i>
</pre>
