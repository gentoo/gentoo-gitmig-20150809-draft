  Changed ebuild to depend on graphvis as per bug #3320.
  While I was at it, changed it so lintool was happy. Therefore, the Author
  field was removed, and copied to here:
  Author Sean Mitchell <sean@arawak.on.ca>, updated Tom von Schwerdtner
  <tvon@etria.org>

  11 May 2002; pvdabeel <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
