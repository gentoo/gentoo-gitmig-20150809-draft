*doxygen-1.2.15-r1 (11 May 2002)

  11 Jun 2002; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org>:
  Changed qt dependency syntax so Portage wouldn't get weird dependency
  problems. Builds fine with qt3.

  02 Jun 2002; Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org>:
  Changed ebuild to depend on graphvis as per bug #3320.
  While I was at it, changed it so lintool was happy. Therefore, the Author
  field was removed, and copied to here:
  Author Sean Mitchell <sean@arawak.on.ca>, updated Tom von Schwerdtner
  <tvon@etria.org>

  11 May 2002; pvdabeel <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  Doxygen compiles and runs perfectly with qt3 too. Both qt2 and qt3
  are supported by the ebuild now

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
