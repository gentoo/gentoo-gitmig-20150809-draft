  <longdescription>Natural Docs is an open-source, extensible, multi-language documentation generator.  It extracts specially formatted comments from source code and builds HTML documentation from it.  The syntax is transparent so that the comments in the source code read just as easily as the generated documentation.  It also focuses on automation and high-quality generated output.</longdescription>
