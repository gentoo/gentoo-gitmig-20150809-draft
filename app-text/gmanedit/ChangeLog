  files/digest-gmanedit-0.3.3-r2 :

  luke@dslextreme.com (Luke Ravitch) submitted a patch so that the configure
  script can find gtk-config.  Funny thing is this patch was just a reversal
  of Hallski's original patch.  So now, the configure script remains unpatched
  and the DEPEND only needs gnome-libs not gnome-core.  Also, general ebuild
  cleanup.

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
