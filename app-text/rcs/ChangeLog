*rcs-5.7-r3 (30 Mar 2005)

  30 Mar 2005; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> +files/conf.diff,
  -files/conf.sh, metadata.xml, rcs-5.7-r2.ebuild, +rcs-5.7-r3.ebuild:
  first of all, the crappy conf.sh file in FILESDIR was really huge, and only
  slightly different from the conf.sh file in the sources. So, replaced that
  with a nice small patch, that will go away when -r2 becomes obsolete.
  Speaking of making it obsolete, -r3 is now here, with a brand spanking new
  patch from debian's unstable which fixes many things, including mktemp ->
  mkstemp, and bug #76550 by t0masek@galerka.com

  Added a one line fix.. that hopefully makes conf.sh script to no fail like it
