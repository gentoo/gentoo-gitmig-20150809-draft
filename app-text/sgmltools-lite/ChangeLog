  Some users report that the CVS directories in the source tree cause emerge
  failures, so these are being removed before make install.

  31 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> sgmltools-lite-3.0.3-r4.ebuild :
  This addresses bug # 1163.  However, there are no symlinks being created for
  the binary.  Instead, a mini shell script is created to call the
  sgmltools binary with the appropriate flag.  Symlinks, however, are created
  for the man pages for the 5 extra binaries.

  pkg_postinst() function, so we do not need to jump through sed hoops to
  achieve that.
