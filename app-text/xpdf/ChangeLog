*xpdf-1.01-r1 (13 Jul 2002)

  15 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :

  Added KEYWORDS.

  13 Jul 2002; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@telia.com> xpdf-1.01-r1.ebuild
 
  This is a new ebuild for xpdf which uses ghostscript T1 fonts which look much nicer, as advised in 
  http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/problems.html#t1lib-base14 . This adds a dependency on app-text/ghostscript. 
  It also fixes a bug in the current ebuild which misses the xpdfrc.5 manpage.

  ebuild submitted by José Fonseca <j_r_fonseca@yahaoo.co.uk>
