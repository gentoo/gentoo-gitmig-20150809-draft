  16 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> tetex-20020901-r1.ebuild :

    Some cleanups and <tab> fixes.  Fix permissions on /usr/share/texmf
    (fowners is not recursive).  Add a patch for not running the config
    stuff during 'make install', as we should rather do it in src_unpack().
