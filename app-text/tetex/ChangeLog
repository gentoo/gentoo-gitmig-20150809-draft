  added filter-flag -fstack-protector

  09 Apr 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> tetex-1.0.7-r12.ebuild,
  tetex-2.0.2.ebuild:
  Updated homepage variable.  Thanks to Eric Sammer!

  14 Mar 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> tetex-2.0.2.ebuild,
  files/tetex-2.0.2-dont-run-config.diff, files/tetex-2.0.2.diff:
  Version bump.  Not many changes.  Still not using texmf-gg.

  25 Feb 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> tetex-1.0.7-r10.ebuild :
  Added hppa to keywords.

  07 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Config protect /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/
  /usr/share/texmf/tex/platex/config/ in order to keep hyphenation patterns
  between updates.

  06 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Re-enable vardir font creation.  This fixes letting ordinary users generate
  font metrics.

*tetex-2.0-r1 (05 Feb 2003)

  21 Feb 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> tetex-2.0-r1.ebuild :
  Mark stable on Alpha

  05 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :
  Revision bump.  Added a patch to fix the local tree.  Also enabled a number
  of Babel formats.  Installation should be all fixed now, too.

  04 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> : tetex-2.0.ebuild
  Fixed installation woes; will now manually remove /usr/share/texmf/dvipdfm if
  it exists.  This should clear up problems with conflicts between versions of
  dvipdfm storing configuration in slightly different fashions.

  05 Feb 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> tetex-2.0.ebuild :
  Updated to use epatch.

  03 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> tetex-1.0.7-r12.ebuild :
  Fixed tetex-1.0.7-r12 to install manpages in correct location.  The make
  install function seems to be broken in 1.0.7, so I had to hardcode man1 into
  it.  This is not the case in 2.0.  Didn't bump revision so as to encourage
  testing of 2.0.

*tetex-2.0 (02 Feb 2003)

  02 Feb 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> tetex-2.0.ebuild :
  teTeX-2.0 is released!  This should fix *so* many bugs it's just
  unbelievable...  Still leaving marked unstable for the freeze, however.

  18 Jan 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> tetex-1.0.7-r12.ebuild :
  Fix bug 13789 again, this time by taking Felix's suggestion.  Thought I had
  it fixed the first time, this time I'm even more thinkful.

  18 Jan 2003; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> tetex-1.0.7-r12.ebuild :
  Fix bug 13789 by pulling in a couple hints from the RH rpm, specifically the
  texmfmain=... part.  Fixed a typo in the specification of datadir and use
  econf/emake/einstall.  Also check for USE=zlib.

*tetex-20030112 (13 Jan 2003)

  13 Jan 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> tetex-20030112.ebuild :

  Added a fix to generate all missing format files upon installation.

  02 Jan 2003; Matthew Turk <satai@gentoo.org> :

    Backport all the fixes in tetex-20020901-r1.ebuild.  Only problem now is

    it already exists ...

  19 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> tetex-20020901-r1.ebuild :

    Ok, this stupid thing still had problems with ownership and unpacking
    on one of my boxes.  Should be fixed now.

  16 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> tetex-20020901-r1.ebuild :

    Some cleanups and <tab> fixes.  Fix permissions on /usr/share/texmf
    (fowners is not recursive).  Add a patch for not running the config
    stuff during 'make install', as we should rather do it in src_unpack().
