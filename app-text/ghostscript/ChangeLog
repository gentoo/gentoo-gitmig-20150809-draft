*ghostscript-7.05.5 (18 Sep 2002)

  18 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  ghostscript-7.05.5.ebuild, files/digest-ghostscript-7.05.5 :
  Version bump.  The 7.05.5 release fixes some problems in the configure
  script, makes several drivers more portable, and updates several drivers 
  including the CUPS, Deskjet, and Lexmark drivers. IJS (hp inkjet) and
  OMNI (IBM) support enabled.  Installs gimp-print driver if X is
  enabled in use variables.  (Didn't want to create another use
  variable and gimp-print is important to high quality printing)
  Currently masked.  Please test especially in a cups environment.
