*ivritex-1.1.1 (11 Jun 2003)

  11 Jun 2003; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ivritex-1.1.1.ebuild:
  Ivritex adds support for Hebrew to teTeX, as well as Hebrew fonts, sample docs
  and the like. A major use of this is to enable LyX to output Hebrew. Thanks to
  Tzafrir Cohen (the author of this package) who directed me to make this
  ebuild.
