*coda-client-6.0.6 (04 Sep 2004)

  04 Sep 2004; Maurice van der Pot <griffon26@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  +coda-client-6.0.3.ebuild, +coda-client-6.0.6.ebuild:
  Took over maintenance from Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>
  Prepared coda-client ebuild for removal from portage because it has been
  superseded by the coda ebuild. For now the new versions of the coda-client 
  ebuild will merge coda as a dependency.

  26 Apr 2004; Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>
  coda-client-5.3.19.ebuild:
  Changed sys-libs/db depend to sys-libs/db-1* as per bug #48902. Thanks Nils
  Ohlmeier <nils@ohlmeier.de>

  coda-client-5.3.19.ebuild, metadata.xml,
  files/coda-client-5.3.19-gentoo3.patch:
  Patch added to fix bug #41321

*coda-client-5.3.19 (23 Jul 2002)

  06 Nov 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> coda-client-5.3.19.ebuild :

  Make not db4 compliant, and take the auto adding and removing from startup
  level default out of the ebuild.

  23 Oct 2002; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> coda-client-5.3.19.ebuild, coda-client-5.3.19-gentoo.patch, coda-client-5.3.19-gentoo2.patch:

  This took forever to make it work, but it does now, gcc-3 compile
  fixes are in gentoo2.patch and there is some sedfu in the ebuild.

  This is this the initial portage commit of this ebuild.

  15 Jul 2002; Greg Briggs <gb006k@mail.rochester.edu> 
  coda-client-5.3.19.ebuild, coda-client-5.3.19-gentoo.patch: 

  Created  ebuild for this package.
  * To test out coda in a hurry, do (as root of course):
      emerge coda-client
      venus-setup testserver.coda.cs.cmu.edu
      /etc/init.d/venus.init start
  Okay, now watch your 11th console until it says "/coda now mounted".
  Now look in /coda for some files; you have connected to the testserver!
  * Notes: You need kernel support for Coda enabled. You definitely need to 
  read the docs to use Coda, at least 
      http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/doc/html/coda-howto-5.html
  The initscript that gets added to your system is "/etc/init.d/venus.init".
  This will also mount coda -- no changes to fstab. By the way, you can test
  with the public Coda server "testserver.coda.cs.cmu.edu".
  * Bugs (these are in other packages I think; it is SAFE TO IGNORE them)
  "cat: write error" during ebuild: a problem in depscan.sh
  "mv: cannot move `cfs0-' to `cfs0': Operation not permitted" during 
    venus-setup: a problem in "( cd /dev ; ./MAKEDEV cfs )"
