*coda-server-6.0.6 (09 Sep 2004)

  09 Sep 2004; Maurice van der Pot <griffon26@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  +coda-server-6.0.3.ebuild, +coda-server-6.0.6.ebuild:
  Took over maintenance from Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>
  Prepared coda-server ebuild for removal from portage because it has been
  superseded by the coda ebuild. For now the new versions of the coda-server
  ebuild will merge coda as a dependency.

*coda-server-5.3.19 (14 Apr 2003)

  coda-server-5.3.19.ebuild ChangeLog files/coda-server-5.3.19-gentoo.patch
  files/digest-coda-server-5.3.19 :

  New package.  This is the coda-client ebuild with a two line change: the
  coda client's initscript patch is not applied, and the einstall installs
  coda-server instead of coda-client.  This ebuild was requested by: Joe
  <ptlame@core.com> in bug #13696, but I don't want to support it, so it's
  looking for a maintainer.
