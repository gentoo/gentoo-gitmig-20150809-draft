*samba-2.2.5 (23 Jun 2002)

  25 Aug 2002; Jack Morgan <jmorgan@gentoo.org> :
  Added sparc64 keyword

  14 Aug 2002; Pieter Van den Abeele <pvdabeel@gentoo.org> :
  Added ppc keyword

  23 Jun 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  Update to latest; samba-2.2.5.  Please see the samba WHATSNEW.txt file
  in /usr/doc/samba for the detailed fixes.  

*samba-2.2.4-r1 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

  o Install smbmnt and smbumount suid root, making user's lives easier; closes #2635.
  o Pass --bindir to ./configure, un-breaking mount.smbfs; closes #2515.
  o Add a few more codepages.

*samba-2.2.4 (6 May 2002)
  
  6 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.4.ebuild,
  smb.conf.example, system-auth-winbind, samba-svc, winbind-init, lmhosts,
  samba-init, nsswitch.conf-winbind, nsswitch.conf-wins :

  Update to latest; samba-2.2.4.

  o Added a much better smb.conf.example
  o Added smbwrapper (smbsh)
  o Added libnss_winbind (see /etc/nsswitch.conf-winbind)
  o Added libnss_wins (see /etc/nsswitch.conf-wins)
  o Added libsmbclient
  o Added USE ssl and ldap support (apparently they work but I haven't had
    time to test them; feedback appreciated.  the support builds ok though.)
  o Added better winbind support including an example nsswitch.conf, a pam.d/
    service snippet and a winbind initscript.  Also see smb.conf.example.
  o Mucho cleaned up the docs (no more 2 copies of the book!)
  o Removed the recycle bin patches.  There is now some generic VFS layer
    support for this.  If you're interested, please see examples/VFS in the
    documentation.  Perhaps we might build it if enough people ask ;)
  o Removed the afs patch.  Consider this unmaintained by me.  If you really
    want it, you'll have to patch, test and submit it yourself.
  o src_install is now all done by hand.  (easier this way, actually)
  o Added a few convenience directories for netlogon, profiles, samba-hosted
    printer drivers and the samba spool directory.  These are only really for
    those who will blindly follow smb.conf.example.  If you already have
    your own setup/layout, they're not really needed.

  ** Changes important for people upgrading **
  o None
    If you're coming from samba-2.2.3, then this is a transparent upgrade.
    Just down your daemon, merge 2.2.4, and bring it back up.

    If you're coming from something older than 2.2.3 there's instructions
    printed after install.  Follow them!

  All-in-all this update basically adds more features, better documentation,
  better out-of-the-box support for various things, and bug fixes.  There
  are no sweeping changes to the package layout and such.

*samba-2.2.3a-r3 (3 May 2002)
  
  3 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  
  Added LICENSE, SLOT, $Headers.

*samba-2.2.3a-r2 (27 March 2002)

  27 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r2.ebuild,
  swat.xinetd, smbusers, samba.rc6, samba-2.2.3a-srv_spoolss_nt.patch :

  The "tidy up a bunch of loose-ends before the 1.0 release, release :)"

  *** Changes important for people upgrading ***:
    o /etc/smb has moved to the better-suited /etc/samba directory.
       Simply move your /etc/smb/* to /etc/samba.  Then delete the /etc/samba/codepages
       directory.  These files are now in /var/lib/samba/codepages since I see no need
       to have 3.3MB of files in /etc which people will never change :)
    o /var/run/smb has moved to /var/run/samba.
       Again, simply move your /var/run/smb/* to /var/run/samba and all will be well.
    o If you have the string "/etc/smb" in your smb.conf file (likely), then please
       change all occurances of that to "/etc/samba".  Thats it, you're done.

  Other changes:
    As mentioned above, /etc/smb/codepages has moved to /var/lib/samba/codepages.  The
    initscript was tweaked to start cupsd before samba and also tweaked to start smbd
    before nmbd.  Added a sample smbusers file.  Added an xinetd snippet for the swat
    service.  Added a patch to fix changing printer properties from Windows NT.

  10 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> files/samba.rc6 :

  Tweak initscript to kill the daemons via pidfile.

*samba-2.2.3a-r1 (5 March 2002)

  5 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r1.ebuild,
  samba-2.2.3a-loadparm.c.patch, samba-2.2.3a-proto.c.patch,
  samba-2.2.3a-reply.h.patch :

  Move the patches to ${FILESDIR}, as they have the same names as those for
  2.2.2, but is not the same, thus ibiblio do not cache the new ones, and
  we get digest errors.

*samba-2.2.3a (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a.ebuild, 
  files/samba-2.2.3a-cli_spoolss_notify.diff, files/samba-2.2.3a-pam_smbpass.diff,
  files/samba-2.2.2-XFS-quota.diff :

  Added acl USE flag support, patch to fix pam_smbpass compilation, patch for Win2k
  printing and removed XFS quota patch -- its merged upstream.  Updated to latest
  network recycle bin patches.  If you get md5 checksum errors with the recycle bin
  patches then:  delete the 3 patches from your local distfiles, and comment out
  your GENTOO_MIRRORS from make.conf/make.globals.  This will ensure that the
  proper patches are fetched from the author's site.

*samba-2.2.2-r9 (2 March 2002)

  2 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.2-r9.ebuild :

  Added creation of symlink for supporting cups printing.

*samba-2.2.2-r8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
