  10 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> files/samba.rc6 :

  Tweak initscript to kill the daemons via pidfile.

*samba-2.2.3a-r1 (5 March 2002)

  5 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r1.ebuild,
  samba-2.2.3a-loadparm.c.patch, samba-2.2.3a-proto.c.patch,
  samba-2.2.3a-reply.h.patch :

  Move the patches to ${FILESDIR}, as they have the same names as those for
  2.2.2, but is not the same, thus ibiblio do not cache the new ones, and
  we get digest errors.

*samba-2.2.3a (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a.ebuild, 
  files/samba-2.2.3a-cli_spoolss_notify.diff, files/samba-2.2.3a-pam_smbpass.diff,
  files/samba-2.2.2-XFS-quota.diff :

  Added acl USE flag support, patch to fix pam_smbpass compilation, patch for Win2k
  printing and removed XFS quota patch -- its merged upstream.  Updated to latest
  network recycle bin patches.  If you get md5 checksum errors with the recycle bin
  patches then:  delete the 3 patches from your local distfiles, and comment out
  your GENTOO_MIRRORS from make.conf/make.globals.  This will ensure that the
  proper patches are fetched from the author's site.

*samba-2.2.2-r9 (2 March 2002)

  2 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.2-r9.ebuild :

  Added creation of symlink for supporting cups printing.

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
