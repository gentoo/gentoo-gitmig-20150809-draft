  3 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :

*samba-2.2.3a-r2 (27 March 2002)

  27 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r2.ebuild,
  swat.xinetd, smbusers, samba.rc6, samba-2.2.3a-srv_spoolss_nt.patch :

  The "tidy up a bunch of loose-ends before the 1.0 release, release :)"

  *** Changes important for people upgrading ***:
    -> /etc/smb has moved to the better-suited /etc/samba directory.
       Simply move your /etc/smb/* to /etc/samba.  Then delete the /etc/samba/codepages
       directory.  These files are now in /var/lib/samba/codepages since I see no need
       to have 3.3MB of files in /etc which people will never change :)
    -> /var/run/smb has moved to /var/run/samba.
       Again, simply move your /var/run/smb/* to /var/run/samba and all will be well.
    -> If you have the string "/etc/smb" in your smb.conf file (likely), then please
       change all occurances of that to "/etc/samba".  Thats it, you're done.

  Other changes:
    As mentioned above, /etc/smb/codepages has moved to /var/lib/samba/codepages.  The
    initscript was tweaked to start cupsd before samba and also tweaked to start smbd
    before nmbd.  Added a sample smbusers file.  Added an xinetd snippet for the swat
    service.  Added a patch to fix changing printer properties from Windows NT.

  10 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> files/samba.rc6 :

  Tweak initscript to kill the daemons via pidfile.

*samba-2.2.3a-r1 (5 March 2002)

  5 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a-r1.ebuild,
  samba-2.2.3a-loadparm.c.patch, samba-2.2.3a-proto.c.patch,
  samba-2.2.3a-reply.h.patch :

  Move the patches to ${FILESDIR}, as they have the same names as those for
  2.2.2, but is not the same, thus ibiblio do not cache the new ones, and
  we get digest errors.

*samba-2.2.3a (4 March 2002)

  4 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.3a.ebuild, 
  files/samba-2.2.3a-cli_spoolss_notify.diff, files/samba-2.2.3a-pam_smbpass.diff,
  files/samba-2.2.2-XFS-quota.diff :

  Added acl USE flag support, patch to fix pam_smbpass compilation, patch for Win2k
  printing and removed XFS quota patch -- its merged upstream.  Updated to latest
  network recycle bin patches.  If you get md5 checksum errors with the recycle bin
  patches then:  delete the 3 patches from your local distfiles, and comment out
  your GENTOO_MIRRORS from make.conf/make.globals.  This will ensure that the
  proper patches are fetched from the author's site.

*samba-2.2.2-r9 (2 March 2002)

  2 March 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> samba-2.2.2-r9.ebuild :

  Added creation of symlink for supporting cups printing.

*samba-2.2.2-r8 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
