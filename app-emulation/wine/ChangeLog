  files/wine-20021007-fake_windows.tar.bz2, files/wine-20021007-misc.tar.bz2 :

  Major rewrite:
  - config, regedit-wine and wine are now in a tarball called ${P}-misc.tar.bz2
  - the fake_windows tarball ( ${P}-fake_windows.tar.bz2 ) goes to ${FILESDIR} now
  - regedit-wine uses the new bin/regedit instead of bin/regapi ( see bug #9001 )
  - the default config is useful now ( running stuff outta the box should work )
  - the wine wrapper ( /usr/bin/wine ) uses /usr/bin/regedit for the initial 
    import of winedefault.reg
  - using do{ins,bin} over mv/cp
  - fixed permissions in /usr/lib/wine/.data
  - added lots of comments

  New revision. This moves wine to its new location in /usr/lib/wine

  files into the wine registry.

  15 Jun 2002; Spider <spider@gentoo.org> wine-20020605-r2.ebuild :

  the /etc/wine stuff wasn't installed so I fixed that 
  (seems the source had moved into documentation/samples)

*wine-20020605-r1 (14 Jun 2002)

  14 Jun 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog  :

*wine-20020228 (5 Mar 2002)

  5 Mar 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> Changelog:
  
  This is the latest snapshot. I've rewritten the ebuild, fixing all known issues,
  including the compilation failures.

  handle the onfig file correctly (there'll be a winesetuptk ebuild sometime soon), and more.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
