*winex-cvs-2.1 (08 September 20002)

  08 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-cvs-2.1.ebuild,
  files/digest-winex-cvs-2.1, files/winex-cvs-fake_windows.tar.bz2,
  files/winex-cvs-regedit, files/winex-cvs-winex :

  This is the new winex-2.1 CVS ebuild. Implemented Dan Armaks new ECVS_BRANCH setting. 
  Thanks Dan. I overwrote the ECVS_TOP_DIR to be able to have multiple versions of
  a local cvs tree on the users harddrive - each branch has its own tree. That should
  speed things up if you often switch between branches; If you dont switch it won't
  waste HD space because you didn't fetch different branches in the first place. :)

*winex-cvs-2.0 (08 September 20002)

  08 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-cvs-2.0.ebuild,
  files/digest-winex-cvs-2.0, files/winex-cvs-fake_windows.tar.bz2,
  files/winex-cvs-regedit, files/winex-cvs-winex :

  This ebuild is identical to the winex-cvs-2.1 ebuild. The name of the ebuild 
  tells portage to fetch the winex-2.0 branch instead. (A simple symlink would
  have done the trick, yes)

*winex-cvs-20020831 (01 September 2002)

  08 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> winex-cvs-20020831.ebuild :
  
  This ebuild is now obsolete. The name puzzled quite a few users.
  There should be no problems with the new naming convention.

  files/winex-cvs-20020831-fake_windows.tar.bz2, files/winex-cvs-20020831-regedit,
  files/winex-cvs-20020831-winex :

  Initial release of the winex-cvs package. In order to have both winex versions
  (the normal one and the cvs one) installed at the same time, i made this one go
  into /usr/lib/winex-cvs. The wrapper is called /usr/bin/winex-cvs and the 
  regedit is named /usr/bin/regedit-winex-cvs.
