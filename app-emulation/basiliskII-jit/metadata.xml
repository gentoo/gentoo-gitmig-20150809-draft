<longdescription>Basilisk II is an Open Source 680x0 Macintosh emulator developed by Christian Bauer. The Basilisk II/JIT project aims at providing a dynamically recompiling 680x0 cpu core to the original Basilisk II. This is achieved thanks to the adaptation of Bernie Meyer's excellent just-in-time (JIT) compiler for UAE to Basilisk II.</longdescription>
