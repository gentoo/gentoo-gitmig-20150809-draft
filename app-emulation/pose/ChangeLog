*pose-3.5-r4 (30 Jan 2004)

  30 Jan 2004; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r4.ebuild :
  a fix for the "touchscreen clicks" problem (#5219),
  thanks to Jake Hamby <jhamby@naobject.com> for spotiing it and the solution
  (a run-time problem, so another revision bump..)

*pose-3.5-r3 (26 Jan 2004)

  26 Jan 2004; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r3.ebuild, files/gcc-3.3_fix.diff.bz2 :
  fixes for fltk and gcc-3.3 problems (#5219 mostly, see also ##26265 and 30210)
  big thanks to Tom Collins <ltskinol@excite.com> for suggesting the fix.

*pose-3.5-r2 (07 Aug 2003)

  07 Aug 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r2.ebuild :
  A weird fix to the fltk problem. Need to have both installed later fltk version 
  and local 1.0.11 in order to build successfully. Will keep it like this for now (#5219)

  30 Mar 2003; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r1.ebuild :
  statick version ceased building at some point. (#5219)
  This is a fix that disables profile version of pose but allows to get "normal" version working.

*pose-3.5-r1 (28 Aug 2002)

  28 Aug 2002; George Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5-r1.ebuild, files/{choose-gl.diff,detect-fluid.diff,init-clipwidget.diff,separate-builddir.diff} :

  checked, did few cosmetic fixes and committed

  28 Aug 2002; David Mott <austmighty@yahoo.com> :
  Changed whole ebuild structure. Now compiles statically.
  A bit of a kludge but it works. Based on John Marshall's
  rpm.spec file for POSE.


*pose-3.5 (10 May 2002)

  22 Jul 2002; Owen Stampflee <owen@gentoo.org> :
  Changed DEPEND to fltk-1.1.0_beta10 as fltk-1.1.0_rc4 breaks
  POSE.

  10 May 2002; G Shapovalov <george@gentoo.org> pose-3.5.ebuild :

  initial release
