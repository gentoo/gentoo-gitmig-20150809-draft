*postfix-1.1.11.200206013-r1 (13 Aug 2002)

  15 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1.ebuild :
  Updated CCARGS and AUXLIBS variables for a proper TLS enabled postfix.

  13 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1 :
  Many changes have been made to the ebuild so I created a -r1.  This
  ebuild should copy smtpd.conf into /etc/sasl2 to match the latest
  cyrus-sasl ebuild.  This should hopefully fix some of the sasl problems
  people have been having with postfix.

*postfix-1.1.11-r5 (23 Jul 2002)

  23 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Use the /etc/postfix/master.cf from the source *again*, as
  they tend to differ between version.  Do NOT change, or if
  you really need to use a custom version, please keep a version
  updated from that version's source.  This should fix the:

   warning: connect #3 to subsystem public/cleanup: Connection refused

  problem.

*postfix-1.1.11.20020613 (22 Jul 2002)

  24 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> :

  Updated ebuild to install the ipv6+tls patch if the ipv6 OR ssl use
  flag is enabled.  This is a temporary hack until I get the patches
  separated from each other and I can enable each addon functionality
  separately.

  23 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> :
  Updated all ebuilds to include the pam dependancy.  Closes bug #5148.

  22 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020613,
  files/tls+ipv6.diff, files/saslv2.diff
  New ebuild with tls and ipv6 support.  Also added support for saslv2.
  Thanks to Philipp Morger for a start on the ebuilds and patches.

  21 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r4.ebuild,
  ChangeLog:
  Cleaned up ebuild once again. Added post-installation note from
  bug #4652 once again. Also fixed ChangeLog since it appeared to
  really got broken.

*postfix-1.1.8-r1 (19 Jul 2002)

  19 Jul 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :
  removed /usr/bin/mail symlink in postfix-1.1.8

*postfix-1.1.11-r4 (19 Jul 2002)

  19 Jul 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :
  removed /usr/bin/mail symlink; that's what mailx and nail are for.
  Removed old versions.  Bumped -r since that symlink really should be yanked.
  Closes bug #5096

*postfix-1.1.11-r1 (09 Jul 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r1.ebuild:
  Added post-installation note about /etc/mail/aliases. No need to update
  if your Postfix installation works correctly. This closes bug #4652.

*postfix-1.1.11 (08 Jul 2002)

  08 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> :
  New version + TLS patch, closes bug #4215.

  20 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.8.ebuild:
  made "sasl" a USE var (disabled by default) since this seems most appropriate
  and since cyrus-sasl appears to be broken if you merge it on a fresh system.
  Postfix should work again.

*postfix-1.1.8 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  Updated to latest postfix + tls patch.

*postfix-1.1.7-r4 (3 May 2002)
  
  3 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  Added LICENSE, SLOT, $Headers.

*postfix-1.1.7-r3 (19 Apr 2002)

  19 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7-r3.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r3 :
  Added INSTALL to dodoc statement.  Closes #1923
  
*postfix-1.1.7-r2 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7-r2.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r2 :
  Changed the USE flags from mta-ldap, mta-tls, and mta-mysql to ldap, ssl, and
  mysql respectively.  Also, changed the checks to the official use foo &&
  syntax.  This has the added advantage of showing the USE flags being used 
  during the emerge process.

  11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r1 :
  digest contains the md5 sums for the postfix tarball and the alternate
  tarball.

*postfix-1.1.7-r1 (8 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7-r1.ebuild:  
  Clean up some tabbing and use official form of 'if use foo' constructs

*postfix-1.1.7 (8 Apr 2002)

  9 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7.ebuild:  
  Updated to postfix 1.1.7, and altered how the 'if use foo' constructs
  are used. Closes #1612

*postfix-1.1.6-r1 (1 Apr 2002)

  1 Apr 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>  :
  Modified the ebuild to link in -lcrypt, -lpam (if pam is in USE),
  and -ldl.  Thanks to Jon Nelson.

*postfix-1.1.6 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.6.ebuild :
  Version bump, using previous ebuild, and adjusting the mta-tls filename to
  fetch.

*postfix-1.1.3-r3 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r3.ebuild :
  Fix compile problem with USE mta-mysql.  Thanks to fkooman@zeelandnet.nl (F. Kooman)
  for the report.  Closes #1328.

  17 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r2.ebuild :
  Clarify the pkg_postinst() message about updating master.cf.  Cosmetic fix only.
  Not bumping package revision.  Closes #1153.

*postfix-1.1.3-r2 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r2.ebuild :
  This update fixes the permissions and ownership on /usr/sbin/postdrop and
  /usr/sbin/postqueue, which were not set correctly last time.  Moved the
  postdrop group detection/creation into pkg_setup() to facilitate this.
  *Really* fix the CCARGS and AUXLIBS getting nuked this time.  Hooray!

*postfix-1.1.3-r1 (18 Feb 2002)

  18 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, postfix-1.1.3-r1.ebuild,
  files/postfix.rc6 files/smtp.pam files/smtpd.conf:
  Lots of changes, ok here we go:  First, we now compile with cyrus-sasl library
  support, which gives us smtp authentication.  Next, there is support for the mta-tls
  USE variable which gives you secure connection support.  There are sample files in
  the files directory for smtp authentication.  This version fixes a glitch with the
  maildrop directory (we now let postfix create it itself, which it will do when you
  run 'postfix check' for the first time after installing this.  We create the postdrop
  group now, in pkg_postinst() if its not already on the user's system.  Some small
  cosmetic changes in the initscript, changing spaces for tabs.  The /var/spool/postfix
  directory is dropped into the system permanently now, which is good.  Fixed a small
  bug with CCARGS getting nuked.  Special thanks goto Ingo Luetkebohle
  <gentoo@blank.pages.de> for an *excellent* bug report.  Thanks Ingo!

  NB: I have successfully tested *outbound* authentication, and leave inbound
  authentication to those using it.  If you find bugs, please report them.  Enjoy.

*postfix-1.1.3 (3 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
