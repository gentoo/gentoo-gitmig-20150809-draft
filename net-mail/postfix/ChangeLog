*postfix-2.0.9 (28 Apr 2003)

  28 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.9-r1.ebuild,
  postfix-2.0.9-get-FQDN.patch :
  Postfix do not get the FQDN if no hostname is specified, and thus do not
  handle the hostname change in latest baselayout gracefully.  Patch it to
  fix this issue.

*postfix-2.0.9 (18 Apr 2003)

  18 Apr 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: New release of postfix.
  Added /usr/bin/rmail to close bug #19127. Added "provide mta" to postfix
  initscript to abide with the recommendation in bug #11455 (not closing since
  other MTAs are affected.) set CC in ebuild to close bugs #16547 and #17275.
  Unmasking for x86 since so many bugs are fixed.

*postfix-2.0.7 (22 Mar 2003)

  Clean up a ton of old stuff, and bump to the latest version.

  24 Mar 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.7.ebuild:
  Update the TLS+IPV6 patch for this version. No need to -r bump, because this
  was a compile stopper

  22 Mar 2003; Brandon Low <lostlogic@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.6.ebuild,
  postfix-2.0.6.ebuild, postfix-2.0.7.ebuild:

*postfix-2.0.3 (28 Jan 2003)

  13 Feb 2003; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.3.ebuild :
  Moved 'inherit eutils' statement back to the top of the ebuild.
  Being placed midway through was causing the package description
  to be replaced with "Based on the eutils eclass" instead of one
  suitable for Postfix.

  12 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.3.ebuild :

  #14725 for noticing this.

  30 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.3.ebuild :
  Marked stable.

  28 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.3.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-2.0.3 :
  Version bump.  tls and ipv6+tls patches have also been updated for

  24 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.2-r1.ebuild :

  19 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.2-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-2.0.2-r1 :
  I made so many individual changes on the last bug I figure I better
  release a new revision.  added maildir and mbox to IUSE.
  Added -lz for linking to mysql.

*postfix-2.0.2 (19 Jan 2003)

  19 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-2.0.2.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-2.0.2 :
  Version bump.  Re-incorporated tls functionality.  IPV6 is next.
  10 minutes later... ipv6 added. :) Changed so
  /var/spool/postfix/tmp is created.  Added some sed logic
  for the editing of main.cf based on maildir or mbox use variable as
  suggested on bug #10356.


*postfix-2.0.0 (23 Dec 2002)

  postfix-1.1.11.20020917-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020917 :
  New ebuild which places the smtpd.conf for sasl2 in /usr/lib/sasl2
  instead of /etc/sasl2.  See bug #10650

  25 Sep 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11-r5.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11-r5:

  23 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020917.ebuild :
  Added /var/spool/postfix/hold directory to install.  This seems to fix
  some postfix start problems.

  20 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020917.ebuild :
  Updated postfix SRC_URI to the pfixtls site.  I have also copied files
  to gentoo distfiles so it propagates across mirrors.  Postfix mirrors
  appear to be too erratic with the "experimental builds"

  19 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020917.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020917,

  version.  Important fixes include ldap and berkdb related fixes.
  See...
  http://archive.progeny.com/postfix/experimental/postfix-1.1.11-20020918.HISTORY
  for the changelog.

*postfix-1.1.11.20020822 (11 Sep 2002)

  17 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020822.ebuild :
  Added saslv1 and saslv2 support.  This should be back to a full
  featured postfix ebuild.

  11 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020822.ebuild :
  provide virtual/mda.  Moved tls+ipv6 patch to ${FILESDIR} and bzipped
  it.  SASL support is next.

  11 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020822.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020822 :

*postfix-1.1.11.200206013-r1 (13 Aug 2002)

  22 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  It appears that this ebuild and digest have magically disappeared from CVS.

  15 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1.ebuild :
  Updated CCARGS and AUXLIBS variables for a proper TLS enabled postfix.
  Fixed a syntax error with the tls+ipv6 patch.

  13 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020613-r1 :
  Many changes have been made to the ebuild so I created a -r1.  This
  ebuild should copy smtpd.conf into /etc/sasl2 to match the latest
  cyrus-sasl ebuild.  This should hopefully fix some of the sasl problems
  people have been having with postfix.

*postfix-1.1.11-r5 (23 Jul 2002)

  11 Sep 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r5.ebuild :
  provide virtual/mda

  29 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r5.ebuild :
  Fixed an logic for applying sasl2 related patch

  22 Aug 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r5.ebuild :
  Fixed typo in pkg_postinst, sasl, and ssl detection code.

  23 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> :
  Use the /etc/postfix/master.cf from the source *again*, as
  they tend to differ between version.  Do NOT change, or if
  you really need to use a custom version, please keep a version
  updated from that version's source.  This should fix the:

   warning: connect #3 to subsystem public/cleanup: Connection refused

  problem.

*postfix-1.1.11.20020613 (22 Jul 2002)

  24 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> :

  Updated ebuild to install the ipv6+tls patch if the ipv6 OR ssl use
  flag is enabled.  This is a temporary hack until I get the patches
  separated from each other and I can enable each addon functionality
  separately.

  23 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> :
  Updated all ebuilds to include the pam dependancy.  Closes bug #5148.

  22 Jul 2002; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>
  postfix-1.1.11.20020613.ebuild, files/digest-postfix-1.1.11.20020613,
  files/tls+ipv6.diff, files/saslv2.diff
  New ebuild with tls and ipv6 support.  Also added support for saslv2.
  Thanks to Philipp Morger for a start on the ebuilds and patches.

  21 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r4.ebuild,
  ChangeLog:
  Cleaned up ebuild once again. Added post-installation note from
  bug #4652 once again. Also fixed ChangeLog since it appeared to
  really got broken.

*postfix-1.1.8-r1 (19 Jul 2002)

  19 Jul 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :
  removed /usr/bin/mail symlink in postfix-1.1.8

*postfix-1.1.11-r4 (19 Jul 2002)

  19 Jul 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :
  removed /usr/bin/mail symlink; that's what mailx and nail are for.
  Removed old versions.  Bumped -r since that symlink really should be yanked.
  Closes bug #5096

*postfix-1.1.11-r1 (09 Jul 2002)

  09 Jul 2002; Maik Schreiber <blizzy@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.11-r1.ebuild:
  Added post-installation note about /etc/mail/aliases. No need to update
  if your Postfix installation works correctly. This closes bug #4652.

  New version + TLS patch, closes bug #4215.

  20 May 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.8.ebuild:
  made "sasl" a USE var (disabled by default) since this seems most appropriate
  and since cyrus-sasl appears to be broken if you merge it on a fresh system.
  Postfix should work again.

*postfix-1.1.8 (13 May 2002)

  13 May 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> :
  Updated to latest postfix + tls patch.

  19 Apr 2002; Ryan Phillips <rphillips@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7-r3.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r3 :
  Added INSTALL to dodoc statement.  Closes #1923
  
*postfix-1.1.7-r2 (15 Apr 2002)

  15 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7-r2.ebuild,
  files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r2 :
  Changed the USE flags from mta-ldap, mta-tls, and mta-mysql to ldap, ssl, and
  mysql respectively.  Also, changed the checks to the official use foo &&
  syntax.  This has the added advantage of showing the USE flags being used 
  during the emerge process.

  11 Apr 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> files/digest-postfix-1.1.7-r1 :
  digest contains the md5 sums for the postfix tarball and the alternate
  tarball.

  9 Apr 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.7.ebuild:

  are used. Closes #1612

*postfix-1.1.6-r1 (1 Apr 2002)

  1 Apr 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org>  :
  Modified the ebuild to link in -lcrypt, -lpam (if pam is in USE),
  and -ldl.  Thanks to Jon Nelson.

*postfix-1.1.6 (30 Mar 2002)

  30 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.6.ebuild :
  Version bump, using previous ebuild, and adjusting the mta-tls filename to
  fetch.

*postfix-1.1.3-r3 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r3.ebuild :
  Fix compile problem with USE mta-mysql.  Thanks to fkooman@zeelandnet.nl (F. Kooman)
  for the report.  Closes #1328.

  17 March 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r2.ebuild :
  Clarify the pkg_postinst() message about updating master.cf.  Cosmetic fix only.

*postfix-1.1.3-r2 (20 Feb 2002)

  20 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> postfix-1.1.3-r2.ebuild :
  This update fixes the permissions and ownership on /usr/sbin/postdrop and
  /usr/sbin/postqueue, which were not set correctly last time.  Moved the
  postdrop group detection/creation into pkg_setup() to facilitate this.
  *Really* fix the CCARGS and AUXLIBS getting nuked this time.  Hooray!

*postfix-1.1.3-r1 (18 Feb 2002)

  18 Feb 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, postfix-1.1.3-r1.ebuild,
  files/postfix.rc6 files/smtp.pam files/smtpd.conf:
  Lots of changes, ok here we go:  First, we now compile with cyrus-sasl library
  support, which gives us smtp authentication.  Next, there is support for the mta-tls
  USE variable which gives you secure connection support.  There are sample files in
  the files directory for smtp authentication.  This version fixes a glitch with the
  maildrop directory (we now let postfix create it itself, which it will do when you
  run 'postfix check' for the first time after installing this.  We create the postdrop
  group now, in pkg_postinst() if its not already on the user's system.  Some small
  cosmetic changes in the initscript, changing spaces for tabs.  The /var/spool/postfix
  directory is dropped into the system permanently now, which is good.  Fixed a small
  bug with CCARGS getting nuked.  Special thanks goto Ingo Luetkebohle
  <gentoo@blank.pages.de> for an *excellent* bug report.  Thanks Ingo!

  NB: I have successfully tested *outbound* authentication, and leave inbound
  authentication to those using it.  If you find bugs, please report them.  Enjoy.

*postfix-1.1.3 (3 Feb 2002)

*postfix-1.1.2-r1 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
