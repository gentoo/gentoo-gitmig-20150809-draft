*vimap-2002c (28 May 2003)
  28 May 2003; Dean Bailey <alron@gentoo.org> vimap-2003c :
  Version bump, new vimap patch for uw-imap 2002c1.

*vimap-2001a (09 Feb 2003)

  09 Feb 2003; Dean Bailey <alron@gentoo.org> vimap-2001a :
  Initial import. Based some of the config off of current uw-imap 
  ebuilds. The other half of the config is from the srpm on the
  vimap website. This ebuild includes many patches by redhat for 
  their uw-imap rpm. Support for maildir and mbox was removed.
  Support for gss (kerberos) was enabled on machines with krb5 
  installed. This provides all of the same deps that uw-imap does.
  Also added xinetd as a dep, as one can not use this package as
  an imap server without it.
