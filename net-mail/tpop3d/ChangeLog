  04 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> tpop3d-1.4.2.ebuild :
  Added KEYWORDS and fixed DEPEND spacing.

  19 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> tpop3d-1.4.2.ebuild,
  files/digest-tpop3d-1.4.2 :
  New ebuild as suggested on bug #4282 by Martin Klebermass.
  Added tests for local variables to enable/disable features that are
  generally not needed, insecure, or rude. :) (seriously!) Also
  added a net-mail/drac ebuild for pop-before-smtp integration and
  included a patch for the optional auth-flatfile support.
