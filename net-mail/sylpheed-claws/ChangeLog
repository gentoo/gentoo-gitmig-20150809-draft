*sylpheed-claws-0.8.1-r1 (17 Aug 2002)

  sylpheed-claws-0.8.1-r1.ebuild files/digest-sylpheed-claws-0.8.1-r1 :

  Jared Hudson (jhhudso@gentoo.org) fixed up the
  embeddable-dillo-within-sylpheed patch from
  http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/dillo/sylpheed/ so that it actually
  works now.  In order to see HTML in e-mails, emerge sylpheed-claws with
  the "gtkhtml" USE flag enabled.  Also, this release has a patch by me to
  make it work with aspell-0.50*
