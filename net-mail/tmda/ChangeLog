*tmda-0.48 ( 1 Mar 2002 )

  1 Mar 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com> tmda-0.48.ebuild :

  Make sure to read /usr/share/doc/tmda-0.48/UPGRADE.gz for important info
  if upgrading from a previous version.

*tmda-0.47 ( 19 Feb 2002 )

  Version 0.47 is released.

*tmda-0.46 ( 8 Feb 2002 )

  14 Feb 2002; Arcady Genkin <agenkin@thpoon.com> tmda-0.46.ebuild :

  Updated the .ebuild file to reflect suggestions from TMDA's author,
  Jason R. Mastaler.  Also, shuffled the things around to make the ebuild's
  organization clearer, and make use of things like 'dobin'.
  There are no user-visible changes to the package, that's why it is not
  bumped up to -r1.

  8 Feb 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> :

  Updated to the latest version; removed -0.45.
  
*tmda-0.45 ( 5 Feb 2002 )

  5 Feb 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> tmda-0.45.ebuild, files/digest-tmda-0.45 :
  
  TMDA (Tagged Message Delivery Agent) is an OSI certified software 
  application designed to significantly reduce the amount of SPAM/UCE
  (junk-mail) you receive.  TMDA combines a "whitelist" (for known/trusted 
  senders), a "blacklist" (for undesired senders), and a cryptographically 
  enhanced confirmation system (for unknown, but legitimate senders).  TMDA 
  strives to be more effectual, yet less time-consuming than traditional 
  filters.
