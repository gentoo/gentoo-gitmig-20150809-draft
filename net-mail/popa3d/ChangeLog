  18 Feb 2004; Hallgrimur H. Gunnarsson <hhg@gentoo.org> popa3d-0.6.4.ebuild:
  Maildir support was chosen as the default when neither the mbox nor the
  maildir USE flags were set. This caused the build to fail, since maildir
  support requires a patch which is only downloaded when the maildir USE flag is
  set. Now, mailbox support is chosen as the default. This was reported in bug
  #41710 by Skyler McCurdy <stupidlimits@yahoo.com>.
