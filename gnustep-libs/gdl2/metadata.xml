The GNUstep Database Library 2 (GDL2) is a set of libraries to map
Objective-C objects to rows of relational database management systems
(RDBMS).  It aims to be compatible with Enterprise Objects Framework
(EOF) as released with WebObjects 4.5 from Apple Inc.  It requires the
GNUstep Make Package 1.9.1 and the Base Library 1.9.1.  Alternatively
it is meant to work with other OpenStep-like implementations like
Cocoa together with the GNUstep BaseAdditions Library 1.9.1.  For UI
applications which may want to use adaptor specific login panels, you
should also install the GNUstep GUI Library 0.9.2 and the GNUstep
Backend Library 0.9.2.
