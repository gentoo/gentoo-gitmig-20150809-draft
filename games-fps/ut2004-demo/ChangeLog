  24 Feb 2004; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> :

  24 Feb 2004; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>
  ut2004-demo-3120-r2.ebuild:
  Added -r2 which includes DEPENDs and logic to fix ALSA and VoIP under the
  game. THIS NEEDS TESTING. It worked for me under both x86 and AMD64, so I am
  including it ~arch on both. This package is hard masked at the moment since it
  needs more testing.

  24 Feb 2004; root <root@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild:
  Added install of README-tts.txt and tts-festival.pl. Also added einfos on how
  to get TTS working.

  24 Feb 2004; <augustus@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild:
  Added AMD64 ping and tts patch.

  ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild:
  Fixing ping patch lines and closing bug #42096.

*ut2004-demo-3120-r1 (20 Feb 2004)

  20 Feb 2004; <augustus@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild,
  ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild:
  Reverted ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild. The patch should have been in a new
  release so that existing users would get it. I moved the changes to
  ut2004-demo-3120-r1.ebuild and fixed it for AMD64. Please don't break other
  ARCH with changes. -r1 is masked for now on AMD64 until icculus releases
  an AMD64 patch.

  19 Feb 2004; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> ut2004-demo-3120.ebuild:
  Updated ebuild to include text-to-speech and server browser ping patches from
  icculus.

  amd64 version has been released, should be on mirrors soon

*ut2004-demo-3120 (13 Feb 2004)

  13 Feb 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Initial import.  Ebuild submitted by me.
