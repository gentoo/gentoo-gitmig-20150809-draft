  23 Jun 2003; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> :
  Updated results.sh script to fix #19392.

  23 May 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Aliz's security "fix"
  actually totally broke this ebuild. In the absence of a working fix, it's
  being removed. Also removing use of evil "games" group.

*ut2003-demo-2206-r1 (16 May 2003)

  16 May 2003; Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org> :

*ut2003-demo-2206 (25 Feb 2003)

  25 Feb 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org> : A new release from
  icculus.org with lots of nice fixes. I'm removing all the older versions of
  ut2003-demo from CVS because this one is clearly preferable and also has a new
  versioning scheme (by build number rather than timestamp.) There still seems
  to be some trouble with the benchmarking, particularly MinDetail. MaxDetail works
  perfectly for me, while MinDetail seems to look for WinDrv for some reason. But
  it works fine when I run the command manually. Weird.
  
  06 Dec 2002; Rodney Rees <manson@gentoo.org> : changed sparc ~sparc keywords
 
*ut2003-demo-20020925-r2 (06 Oct 2002)

  25 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, ut2003-demo-20020925-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-ut2003-demo-20020925-r1, files/results.sh, files/ut2003-demo:

  Removed results.py and added results.sh. This makes the ebuild compatible with the 
  LiveCD (the LiveCD doesnt come with python).

*ut2003-demo-20020925 (25 Sep 2002)

  25 Sep 2002; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, ut2003-demo-20020925.ebuild :

  My bad, 1080c is not a new patch, but a supplement to 1080b ... this fixes that ... #8313

  files/digest-ut2003-demo-20020918, files/results.py, files/ut2003-demo, files/benchmark:

  Revision bump. Added a wrapper which is able to benchmark ut2003. Made the game

  files/digest-ut2003-demo-20020918 :

  This version includes the patch 1080. Installation directory switched to /opt
  again, sorry for that (this was the last location change, i promise). 

*ut2003-demo-20020915 (15 Sep 2002)
  
  17 Sep 2002; phoen][x <phoenix@gentoo.org> ChangeLog, ut2003-demo-20020915.ebuild:

  chmod'ed the whole game to "o-rwx" - that prevent users who aren't members of
  group 'games' from playing the game. Added a message about that to pkg_postinst().

  Added "-f" to "rm ${S}/${FILENAME}",

  files/digest-ut2003-demo-20020915, files/misc.tar.bz2: 

  Initial import. This package installs the official Unreal Tournament 2003 demo to 
  /opt/ut2003-demo.

  Modified DEPEND.

  Added --nox11 to prevent the installer from starting.
