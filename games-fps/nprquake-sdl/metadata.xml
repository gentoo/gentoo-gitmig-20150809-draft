Non-PhotoRealistic Rendering (npr) is often considered the task of taking a 3d 
environment and displaying it as if it were (for example) hand-drawn. Stylization is 
the main purpose of an npr, as is with most pencil-and-paper artists (imagine if 
everyone who drew cartoons tried to make them look as realistic as possible - 
boring!). NPRQuake attempts to capture the elements of different drawing techniques, 
and immerse the viewer in worlds drawn entirely in the prescribed style. If you have 
ever imagined running around inside a painting or a drawing, you are beginning to 
get the idea.
