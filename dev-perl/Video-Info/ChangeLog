  +Video-Info-0.993.ebuild:
  Bug 118614 has pointed out that 0.999, which has been the tree forever now,
  was a bogus release, and that 0.993 was the last good release on cpan.
  Thanks ruetama for pointing this out - too bad it had to happen after I
  finally marked 0.999 stable (stub that it is)
