  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.81.ebuild, CGI-2.91.ebuild:
  We had a situation (bug #18150) where the version of dev-perl/CGI was
  between that in the perl 5.6.1 and the 5.8.0 core.  After discussions
  with dragon, avenj, carpaski, and lostlogic, it seemed most prudent to
  bring the stable standalone CGI.pm version to 2.81 (same as in the
  5.8.0 core).

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.78-r3.ebuild:
  Change perl dependency to <=5.6.1, so as not to overwrite the newer version in
  5.8.0. Due to some technical problems with that, currently using =5.6.1*.
