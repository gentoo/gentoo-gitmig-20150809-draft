*CGI-2.93 (01 May 2003)

  01 May 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.91.ebuild, CGI-2.91.ebuild,
  CGI-2.93.ebuild:
  Upstream version bump, required to enable make test in mod_perl

*CGI-2.81 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.81.ebuild, CGI-2.91.ebuild:
  We had a situation (bug #18150) where the version of dev-perl/CGI was
  between that in the perl 5.6.1 and the 5.8.0 core.  After discussions
  with dragon, avenj, carpaski, and lostlogic, it seemed most prudent to
  bring the stable standalone CGI.pm version to 2.81 (same as in the
  5.8.0 core).

*CGI-2.78-r3 (26 Mar 2003)

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.78-r3.ebuild:
  temporary back out #18150 fix until can fix properly

  26 Mar 2003; <rac@gentoo.org> CGI-2.78-r3.ebuild:
  Change perl dependency to <=5.6.1, so as not to overwrite the newer version in
  5.8.0. Due to some technical problems with that, currently using =5.6.1*.
  Thanks to Michael Cummings <mcummings@gentoo.org> in bug #18150.

  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
