  files/digest-SDL-sdlpl-1.18.4 :

  Dave Goehrig of sdlperl.org has kindly issued this release to help us sort
  the silly Mesa headers thing.  It turns out, however, that we need to
  supply sdl-perl's compilation process the headers to nvidia's gl.h and
  glu.h files.

  Did some sed'ing to include the location of the opengl header files that
  the nvidia drivers provide.

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> skel.ChangeLog :
  
  This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the comments should be
  well explained and written in clean English. 
  
  Every new version or revision of the package has to be marked by a '*'
  seperator line as above. Changements since the last revision have to be
  added to the top of the file, underneath the initial copyright and cvs header
  comments, in exactly the same format as this comment.
  
  This means that you start with header line that has the following format :
  
      date; your_name <your_email> changed_file1, changed_file2 :
	  
  Below that line your explanation should follow. It has to be indented,
  paragraphed and wrapped at a linewidth of 80 characters.
  
  Any details about what exactly changed in the code should be added as a
  message when the changes are committed to cvs, not in this file.
