    KBoincSpy is a KDE monitor and control utility for the BOINC client. It
	displays a lot of useful information about the computation of work units,
	such as the percent of work done, and estimates of the completion time and
	credits granted. For some projects like SETI@home and ClimatePrediction.net,
	it also reports some interesting data about the content and significance of
	each work unit being analyzed.
