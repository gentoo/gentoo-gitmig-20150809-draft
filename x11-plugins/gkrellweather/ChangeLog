  Relocated to x11-plugins

  30 May 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r2.ebuild :

  Hmmm.  The GrabWeather script is hardcoded into /usr/share/gkrellm only
  in the Debian version.  I added the debian patch which does just that.

*gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1 (18 Mar 2002)

  18 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> gkrellweather-0.2.7-r1.ebuild :

  Adjusted copyright, and made the script go into /usr/share/gkrellm where it is
  expected, instead of /usr/bin.  The expected location of the GrabWeather
  script seems to be hardcoded.

*gkrellweather-0.2.7 (1 Feb 2002)

  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
