		wmalms monitors data obtained from a sensor chip: temperature, fan
		speed, and voltage. It can be used as a dockable/swallowed applet
		with Window Maker or any window manager that supports swallowing,
		including GNOME, kwm (KDE), fvwm, and its clones. Alternatively, you
		can run wmalms as a normal window with any window manager. wmalms is
		designed to suit any hardware supported by lm_sensors. It provides a
		wide range of customized features, including window appearence,
		order and representation of sensor data, refresh frequency, alarm
		mode, etc.
