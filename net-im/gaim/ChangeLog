*gaim-0.58-r3 (26 June 2002)

 26 June 2002; Stuart Bouyer <stubear@gentoo.org> gaim-0.58-r3.ebuild :

 Korean patch fails to compile without nls. Added test for nls in USE 
 before patching.

*gaim-0.58-r2 (14 June 2002)

 14 June 2002; Jays Kwak <jayskwak@gentoo.org> gaim-0.58-r2.ebuild :

 Korean encoding patch added. It should be ok with other languages.
 If this patch has problem with other languages, you can comment it.

*gaim-0.58-r1 (12 June 2002)

 12 June 2002; Michael J. Cohen <mjc@gentoo.org> gaim-0.58-r2.ebuild :

 Transparency support added. Thanks ChipX86 in #gaim.  Careful, the patch -p0
 is commented out because currently it segfaults often.


*gaim-0.58-r1 (17 May 2002)

  17 May 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> gaim-0.58-r1.ebuild :

  Building of both gaim and gaim_applet executables fixed (econf added back).
  Fixes bug #2786.

*gaim-0.58 (16 May 2002)

  16 May 2002; William McArthur <sandymac@gentoo.org> gaim-0.58.ebuild :

  The src_install function was installing files into /var/tmp/portage/...
  fixed that. The ebuild also used econf which I belive has been deprecatied and
  removed. I highly suggest you merge this version as it is much better.
