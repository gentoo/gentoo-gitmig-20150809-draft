Bigloo is a Scheme implementation devoted to one goal: enabling Scheme
based programming style where C(++) is usually required. Bigloo attempts
to make Scheme practical by offering features usually presented by
traditional programming languages but not offered by Scheme and functional
programming. Bigloo compiles Scheme modules. It delivers small and fast
stand alone binary executables. Bigloo enables full connections between
Scheme and C programs, between Scheme and Java programs, and between
Scheme and C# programs.
