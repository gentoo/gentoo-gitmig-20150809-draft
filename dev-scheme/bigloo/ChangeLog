  Bigloo is a Scheme implementation devoted to one goal: enabling Scheme based
  programming style where C(++) is usually required. Bigloo attempts to make 
  Scheme practical by offering features usually presented by traditional 
  programming languages but not offered by Scheme and functional programming.
  Bigloo compiles Scheme modules. It delivers small and fast stand alone 
  binary executables. Bigloo enables full connections between Scheme and C 
  programs and between Scheme and Java programs.
