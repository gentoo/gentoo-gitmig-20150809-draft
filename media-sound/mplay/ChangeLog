  04 Sep 2004; Chris White <chriswhite@gentoo.org> mplay-0.68.ebuild:
  Fixed the docs installation. mplay was looking for help_de/en in
  /usr/share/mplay, wasn't finding them(because they weren't installed in the
  first place :). Installed them in /usr/share/mplay, left the rest of the docs
  installed in /usr/share/doc/ nice and gzipped to save space. This closes bug
  #62726.
