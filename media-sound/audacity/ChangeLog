  19 Jul 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>:
  Reverted to previous version

*audacity-1.1.3-r1 (17 Jul 2003)

  17 Jul 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.3-r1.ebuild:
  Changed media-sound/mad dep to media-libs/{libmad,libid3tag}

*audacity-1.1.3 (12 Apr 2003)

  12 Apr 2003; jje audacity-1.1.3.ebuild:
  Version bump. Cleaned up ebuild from previous version.

*audacity-1.1.1-r1 (30 Jan 2003)

  17 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  Added a hook so gtk2 in USE causes the compile to stop and warn
  the user of the incompatibility.

  12 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/basecfg-1.1.1 :
  Added a very basic configuration so when building against wxGTK,
  starting it doesn't cause a segfault.

  04 Feb 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.1-r1.ebuild :
  I have now tested audacity with wxGTK-2.4.0 and it works great.

  30 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.1-r1.ebuild,
  files/digest-audacity-1.1.1-r1 :
  Updated ebuild to depend on wxGTK-2.2.9* as wxGTK-2.4.0 causes
  a segfault on startup.  Updated to the -3 audacity tarball.
  Added a system dependancy on >=libsndfile-1.0.0.  CVS should
  be compatible with =wxGTK-2.4* real soon now. :)  I'm not motivated
  to do an audacity-cvs build yet as it has been very unstable.
  Once I start seeing the code base become more stable I may consider
  it.

*audacity-1.1.1 (15 Jan 2003)

  15 Jan 2003; Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org> audacity-1.1.1.ebuild, 
  files/digest-audacity-1.1.1, files/mono_mp3_export.patch :
  Version bump.  Marked stable as it depends on wxGTK-2.4.x which
  has also been released as stable.  Thanks to the anonymous
  "Gentoo User" on bug #13978 for the mono patch.

  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
