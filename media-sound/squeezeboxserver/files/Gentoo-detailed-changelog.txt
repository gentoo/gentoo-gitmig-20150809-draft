Utilises Data::UUID rather than UUID::Tidy
	A patch is included to use Data::UUID since this is in
	Portage (UUID::Tiny isn't)

Removed redundant musepack USE flag

Allow an external SQL server
	A small tweak from jaervosz@gentoo.org (see bug#287257) to allow an
	external MySQL server by only depending on it if it's installed.

For Torsten: prefs in /etc rather than in /var/lib/squeezeboxserver/prefs

For Torsten: Uses EAPI2 and use flag dependencies (a tidying up)

Fixed build-modules with 'noexec' portage
	Now copies the script into the source directory during the build process
	to avoid trying to execute a script in the FILES directory - this fails
	on Portage trees mounted 'noexec' (comment#25 in bug#287257).

For Torsten: failure checks on newexe's

For Torsten: EAPI2 and USE dependencies

For Torsten: Fewer hardiwred paths in ebuild
	Uses get_libdir and Perl installvendorlib

The following Gentoo bugs should be able to be closed with this update:

	bug#275520 (dev-perl/Class-XSAccessor-Array phaseout)
