  Mark 0.59s-r1 stable on x86 for bug 40631. Remove older ebuilds. Add this

  a bugzilla account to get somebody to test.

  15 Feb 2004; Jason Wever <weeve@gentoo.org> mpg123-0.59s-r1.ebuild:
  Marked stable on sparc to fix bug #40631.

  ebuilds)

  files/mpg123-0.59r-amd64.diff, files/mpg123-0.59s-amd64.patch:
  fix mpg123-0.59r-r3 as it was marked stable on amd64. The amd64 patch wasn't
  being pulled out of the patch ball, manually epatch it. The diff for
  mpg123-0.59s had a bunch of .orig files in it which made the patch huge,
  remove. Remove the diff for mpg123-0.59r as it's in the patchball.

  patch for 0.59s and amd64

  06 Oct 2003; Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org>
  files/mpg123-0.59r-amd64.diff:
  removal of amd64 patch broke mpg123 on amd64. apparently whatever was done to
  put it in a package on the server, this patch wasn't part of that and should
  not have been removed.

  30 Sep 2003; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> mpg123-0.59r-r1.ebuild,

  files/mpg123-0.59r-sparc.diff, files/mpg123-0.59s-security.diff:
  Bug 26787 alerts to a local/remote exploit in mpg123-0.59s. In the process of
  fixing this bug with patches available at:
  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2003-01/0117.html a potential
  security fix in 0.59r was also fixed. Additionally, the patches for 0.59r now
  reside in their own tarball on the mirrors, instead of cluttering up the files
  subdirectory.

  19 Jul 2003; jje <jje@gentoo.org> mpg123-0.59s.ebuild:
  Last development version. Adds support for id3_v2 tags. I'm a little nervous 
  about adding this as it doesn't look like it is still being worked on 
  upstream. If it proves to be stable it may be what we live with.
