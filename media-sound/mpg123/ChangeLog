  Bug 26787 alerts to a local/remote exploit in mpg123-0.59s. In the process of
  fixing this bug with patches available at:
  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2003-01/0117.html a potential
  security fix in 0.59r was also fixed. Additionally, the patches for 0.59r now
  reside in their own tarball on the mirrors, instead of cluttering up the files
  subdirectory.

  version from Andres Meyer <andres.meyer@computer.org>, fixes bug #25587

  19 Jul 2003; jje <jje@gentoo.org> mpg123-0.59s.ebuild:
  Last development version. Adds support for id3_v2 tags. I'm a little nervous 
  about adding this as it doesn't look like it is still being worked on 
  upstream. If it proves to be stable it may be what we live with.
