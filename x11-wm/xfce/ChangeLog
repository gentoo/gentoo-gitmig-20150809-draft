*xfce-3.8.18 (12 Nov 2002)

  12 Nov 2002; Brad Cowan <bcowan@gentoo.org> xfce-3.8.18.ebuild,
  files/digest-xfce-3.8.18 :

  Version bump.

*xfce-3.8.16 (25 Apr 2002)

  25 Apr 2002; Grant Goodyear <g2boojum@gentoo.org> xfce-3.8.16.ebuild :

  New version.

  8 Apr 2002; M.Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org> files/xfce :

  Change start command to /usr/bin/startxfce.

*xfce-3.8.14 (28 Mar 2002)

  28 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfce-3.8.14.ebuild :

  Made gdk-pixbuf dependent on the gtk USE toggle instead of gnome, since
  gdk is tied to gtk, not gnome.  This is admittedly strange since gtk is
  actually a required dependency.

*xfce-3.8.14 (27 Mar 2002)

  27 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfce-3.8.14.ebuild :

  norbert@nrpil.tmfweb.nl (Norbert Pil) submitted the version update.

*xfce-3.8.11-r3 (17 Mar 2002)

  17 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> xfce-3.8.11-r3 :
  The LICENSE file is no longer distributed with the source, so I removed the
  entry for that from the dodoc statement.  While I was at it, I decided to
  have the `make install` step which installs the html documentation, place 
  the html stuff into /usr/share/doc/${PF} where all the other docs are, instead
  of /usr/share/xfce/doc where they are installed by default.

*xfce-3.8.11-r2 (12 Mar 2002)

  12 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Copied over the -r1 ebuild and added a check for the nls toggle in USE.

*xfce-3.8.11-r1 (14 Feb 2002)

  14 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  Added /etc/X11/Sessions/xfce, which adds xfce to the auto-generated
  session list in kdm and gdm.

*xfce-3.8.11 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
