  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.13-r2 files/fluxbox-0.1.13-*.patch

  This is a somewhat major collection of updates. Fluxbox initialy had some
  issues with menu/taskbar fonts being screwy when a session was first
  started. OpenOffice was crashing, which was previously being solved by
  configuring with --disable-newwmspec. NLS files were not getting installed.
  All of the above have been patched/fixed.

  The menukey patch is still applied. The remember patch has also been
  applied to this release. Unlike the previous remember patch, this one
  builds fine if -nls is in your USE.

*fluxbox-0.1.13-r1 (21 Nov 2002)

  21 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.13-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.13-r1 files/fluxbox-0.1.13-menukey.patch

  Patch applied to allow manipulation of the root applications menu with
  standard keybindings. In your ~/.fluxbox/keys files you can now make
  use of: WindowMenu, NextMenuItem, PrevMenuItem, SelectMenuItem,
  OpenSubmenu, and CloseMenu. For instance:

  Control Right :OpenSubmenu

  No found issues with any flags or build types associated with fluxbox
  

*fluxbox-0.1.13 (19 Nov 2002)

  19 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.13.ebuild
  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.13 ChangeLog

  Version bump to latest stable. Fluxbox now has Xft support! Also, build
  was edited to grab the .bz2 instead of the .gz, and the new menu
  generation script was yanked and scheduled to be adapted to commonbox.

*fluxbox-0.1.12-r2 (26 Oct 2002)

  4 Nov 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.12-r2.ebuild

  Minor edit to ebuild to test for absence of nls in USE (remember
  patched version will not build without it. Furthering the effort
  to deal with bug #9909

  26 Oct 2002; Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.12-r2.ebuild
  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.12-r2 :

  Added the remember patch. This patch adds an extra submenu to the WindowMenu
  that allows you store each windows workspace, deminsions, position, shaded
  state, tab state, decoration state, and sticky state and also to save the
  settings on application close. It also enabled the use of a Startup submenu
  in your applications menu. Any items in this submenu will be automatically
  started when you start fluxbox.

  There are scant warnings about crashes with this patch, but neither I nor
  anyone I have spoken with have experienced any issues. As allways, report
  any problems to http://bugs.gentoo.org/.

  Fluxbox with the remember patch will not install with "-nls" in your USE.
			

*fluxbox-0.1.12-r1 (17 Sep 2002)

  05 Oct 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:

  To give credit where credit is due, the RootMenu patch was in fact
  created by Junichiro Kita <kita@kitaj.no-ip.com> and is maintained on his
  website: http://kitaj.no-ip.com/files/fluxbox/

  17 Sep 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.12-r1.ebuild
  files/digest-fluxbox-0.1.12-r1 :

  Update: few hours later: Rach refined the patch a little and added a
  subtle blurb in the fluxbox manpage as well.  Mucho thanks :)

  This revision bump incorporates two patches.  The first is the Vano patch
  from bug #5005 which makes the root menu disappear on left click anywhere.
  The second is the rootmenu patch which was posted many months ago on the
  fluxbox mailing lists against an older version of fluxbox.  The patch was
  recently foreported to this version of flux by Rach Holmes.  The
  original patch was BSD licensed, as is Rach's version of it.  Basically,
  it allows the rootmenu to be bound to a key. So, for instance, in
  ~/.fluxbox/keys:

  Mod4 :RootMenu

  will cause the fluxbox menu to open when the "windows logo" key is pressed
  (x86 machine).  Use xmodmap etc to flavour as you like it.  Seemant is on
  an x86 and has these entries in his local keys file (the left windows key
  opens the root menu, the right side windows key closes it).  The windows
  menu key (right click menu in windows) opens up flux's window menu

  None Super_L :RootMenu
  None Super_R :CloseMenu
  None Menu :WindowMenu
  Shift Right :OpenSubMenu
  Shift Return :SelectMenuItem
  Shift Up :PrevMenuItem
  Shift Down :NextMenuItem

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (20 Mar 200)

  20 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  Removed gnome and kde from the deps, because they are NOT required in order
  to compile support for them.  The KDE support is meaningless without KDE 
  installed, but it is harmless and leads to less bloat if KDE wasn't intended
  to be installed in the first place.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (15 Mar 2002)

  16 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  Added /etc/X11/Sessions/fluxbox pointer. Didn't bother updating revision 
  as the fix is so small.

  Removed old revisions.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r3 (15 Mar 2002)

  15 Mar 2002; Seemant Kulleen <seemant@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r3.ebuild :

  This package now provides virtual/fluxbox, so as to allow blackbox
  applications (which are completely compatible with fluxbox) to run without
  having to emerge blackbox as well.

*fluxbox-0.1.7-r2 (9 Mar 2002)

  9 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r2.ebuild :

  Added upstream patch.

  Removed old revisions.

  9 Mar 2002; Karl Trygve Kalleberg <karltk@gentoo.org> fluxbox-0.1.7-r1.ebuild :

  <mettlerd@icu.unizh.ch>.

*fluxbox-0.1.7 (2 Mar 2002)

  2 Mar 2002; Bruce A. Locke <blocke@shivan.org> fluxbox-0.1.7.ebuild :

  Update to 0.1.7

*fluxbox-0.1.6-r1 (14 Feb 2002)

  14 Feb 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added /etc/X11/Sessions/fluxbox, which adds fluxbox to the auto-generated
  session list in kdm and gdm.

*fluxbox-0.1.6 (1 Feb 2002)

  1 Feb 2002; G.Bevin <gbevin@gentoo.org> ChangeLog :
  
  Added initial ChangeLog which should be updated whenever the package is
  updated in any way. This changelog is targetted to users. This means that the
  comments should well explained and written in clean English. The details about
  writing correct changelogs are explained in the skel.ChangeLog file which you
  can find in the root directory of the portage repository.
