*sawfish-2.0 (24 Jun 2002)

  Version update.  Finally figured out why it moans about the ${S}/src/.libs
  not existing ... when using "emake", the build gets out of sync.  Also
  fixed a problem where the lisp modules tries to use gui.gtk-2.gdk-pixbuf ..
  this is now merged with gui.gtk-2.gtk.

  exist, as it causes the lisp stuff to fail building.
