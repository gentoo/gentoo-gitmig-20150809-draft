  31 Jul 2003; Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org> fvwm-2.5.7.ebuild:
  imlib USE flag

  31 Jul 2003; Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org> fvwm-2.5.7.ebuild:
  Re-written ebuild to take full advantage of all the optional features
  available. As this is a dramatic change to how the gentoo FVWM ebuilds work,
  I wont be changing the stable branch to work like this.

  Adding ncurses USE flag, if USE="readline ncurses" FvwmConsole links with
  ncurses, with USE="readline -ncurses" it links with and depends on 
  libtermcap.
