    PLplot is a library of functions that are useful for making scientific
    plots. It can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++,
    FORTRAN and Java, as well as interactively from interpreted languages such
    as Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl. It is capable of producing standard x-y
    plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh
    plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs may be composited, and it
    also supports a large variety of output file devices such as Postscript,
    PNG, JPEG, LaTeX and others. It is also possible to to use interactive
    devices such as xwin, tk and xterm as output devices. PLplot also offers
    support for extended characters inculding the Greek alphabet and a host of
    mathematical symbols.
